The brightness and clarity of the picture is another huge by step forward in the evolution of  the television. I find myself seeking out programming that will showcase the quality of the picture regardless of the genre or intended audience. Some of the newer, computer generated cartoons, lack any redeemable qualities (imho) save for the incredible graphics, which are stunningly colorful, bright, and almost as vivid as real life. Nature documentaries and shows involving space, especially when shot in 4K are almost mesmerizing. When I bought my 65” HD tv about 10 years ago I thought I was witnessing the best quality picture that could be produced by anything this side of a mirror. I was wrong, and happily so. If you’re on the fence, like I was, about whether to replace a broken or outdated television with another of similar HD quality, that is to say “standard high definition”...don’t even waste your time. It’s increasingly difficult to find as 4K is becoming ubiquitous, so that is pretty much a given. On the subject of spending your hard earned money on the more expensive OLED technology....if you have the means, or can somehow figure out how to acquire the means...my advice is definitely do so. Whether you’re into movies, sports, gaming, or even nature/space shows, you will be amazed at the latest leap in picture quality and brightness. And VIZIO offers all the quality at a substantial savings. Putting the absolute best technology within the reach of those of us for whom the strength of the stock market makes absolutely no difference to our bottom line. 
FYI...the 65” HD television I had to replace was a Samsung that was about 4 or 5 years old that stopped working after some loud cracking and popping noises that sounded like the transformer on an overhead power line blowing out. However, my 42” VIZIO that I bought in ‘08 doesn’t even have a single bad pixel.

Pros:
1. The picture is absolutely gorgeous and you can tune it further to your choice.
2. The Smartcast interface is decent.
3. The remote is also not bad at all.
4. Very quick to connect apple play. 
5. There are ample connection options for my bedroom
Cons:
1. Cast is buggy. I can never get it to run first time. This is where I would focus most of the development time if I were Vizio.
2. Smart Cast does not have a browser app that is accessible easily.
3. There is no easy way to add more apps that are not already in the Vizio library.
4. The detail picture quality will not go up to the level you get out of a top line OLED. 
5. The bezel is still not near zero bezel size. It is sizable to be noticeable.

The AI is ok but they are just annoying, the game is really confusing and not very fun. I have to get updates everytime i want to play, even when i dont play it online at all, I hate patches.

And I have played alot of RTS games, so I know what I'm talking about. This game has very good graphics, and they will be even more enjoyable the more you paly the game, considering that you notice things like shadows cast by the terrain, and details such as distortion coming out of a walkers exhaust pipes. This game also has an amazing command system. There are more controls and options you can use to make your army do anything imaginable. This game also includes extra experimental weapons, which they balanced much better than on the first one, and actually have a general purpose rather than to walk into the enemies base and kill. And most people have heard that the nukes on the second ones are pitiful compared to the first. The difference is that on the first one, it was a bright light and smoke covering a large area of the map. On this one, it might be only a little bit smaller, but it is insanely detailed, in the fact that an extremely large portion of the map gets lit up in red, and things are actually moving with the explosion as they would in real life. When it touches water it makes steam and jets it into the air, so nukes on this one are much more enjoyable to watch, regardless of what you've heard.

Then i would of not had any quarrels with it, because i wouldn't be expecting something so different than what i knew. Now i own both of the ""previous"" games and they are both excellent, and so when i found out about this ""sequel"" i ran out and bought it with out much looking into it, i knew it had a different maker but i figured how bad could they have possibly made it... i mean it's Square Enix! Now don't get me wrong it is a good game, but i was expecting to buy SC2... Not SC2 revamped... i couldn't just jump into it, i had to learn the new feel to the game. In SC2 you now get to your good units by having to research most of them, and experimental units are really not that great, yea they are all based of the old games models but i think that most kinda suck comparatively... like the experimental units, for so called ""game breakers"" as they were know for in the old games, u can make them with very little ease and there not nearly as effective as they use to be.... which i guess is the trade off for it, but even hordes of units can crumble in no time it seems.  Regular units are just knock offs of the original ones and are only really good when you upgrade them via research.  However i do think the research is a cleaver aspect of the game and the brand new units/structures that were added are a nice touch, but it does usually take awhile to get to them in the research tree even with the research facilities which u can build to increase research income.  completely  Also the variety of units is gone there use to be at least 2 sets of everything... a lower cost, lower tech versions, and the higher end units, which i prefer the variety of them because they all had there uses, lower tech units could be used as cannon fodder, as your high end tech marches on, or even if you had to come up with an army quickly.  All that said i do still play it as i've gotten use to it, but i am still disappointed, if you are looking for something different to play with a somwhat familiar story, then you would like the game play; especially online to which it seems that it was made for, but if your expecting the feel of the original game then i would say go play one of the old ones...",No: I don’t recommend this product,,2,1,11 years ago,,3.0,3.4091,22,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10075055%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=0,15250429,e9076023-ffe4-5db0-9cc5-bf94c47e130f,2022-01-16T16:17:59

If they left some of the things from the old sup com in, it would be so unbalanced it wouldn't been as fun to play for the newbies.  Alright so lets get down to buisness, the storyline is great and the graphics blow sup com 1's out of the water, while supporting older computers that don't have as good of processors or graphics card. Win, Win situation. At least thats what I think, and that is why you're here isn't it ??   They added a new research screen to simplify it and added a whole bunch of new features like building add ons and new experimentals. FYI to all aion illuminate fans, they don't have naval anymore. I know, ouch right? Well I think we'll live.  On to sound. They did a really good job with the music this time, its about 10 times better than sup com 1 and the sound effects really match up and exceed what you think they will sound like, when lets say someone gets blown up by a nuke or someones commander goes into meltdown.  For all those hard core gamers out there, the 10 hour battles have gone away, I know, sad right? Well they replaced with a shorter even fiercer model of online game play, that really seems to fit, and when I mean shorter, I mean average of two hours. You can still build those big armies just faster. One thing I wanna finish up with is the Interface. They kept a lot of the interface from sup com 1 and FA, but also added the research screen which I talked about earlier. It works like this: You need research points to buy any sort of research upgrades and those research points automatically come along, but you can build research facilities that increase the speed at which you get them. You can spend research points on things like, personal shields for your units, or new buildings, sight upgrades, radar upgrades, and new schematics for buildings and units.

It almost feels like a very weak demo of SupCom 1, but worse. Even with the new research trees, you'll still end up with no where near the amount of units to choose from that you had with SupCom 1 and its tiers. Yeah, sometimes the tiers were annoying to work through and it took far too long in most instances to get anywhere close to maximizing your faction's potential in a single match in the first one - but this ""sequel"" has completely gutted it altogether. You'll likely end up mashing your mouse button or hotkey to churn out more of the exact same units.. over... and over... and over again because there's barely anything to choose from for unit diversity. The game requires the Steam client and an internet connection just to play. While it's true that most people these days have an internet connection, it's a rather unfortunate decision not only because you're excluding gamers but also because of potential happenstance scenarios. Steam goes down? Sorry, you're out of luck. A few years down the road and something else happens(such as one of the companies going out of the business or whatnot) and you can't go back to play it for old times sake? Again, out of luck. Move to an area with limited connectivity? Same thing. I wish developers would stop going with this route, as it's very short-sighted. The graphics are significantly worse than the first one, even on the highest settings. There are ONLY small maps, and no larger maps to choose from. In the first version you had a large selection of maps, in SupCom2 there are around 10-15, and all of them are the same size pretty much. I want to be clear one more time about the gameplay here: This is not a merely ""different"" approach. I'm pretty open-minded and I'll try just about anything. This is a GUTTED approach to the first version's gameplay. It takes many of the great features out, and doesn't replace them - it does away with them altogether. Fewer units with no tiers or variety. Smaller selection of maps with almost no size difference in any. Worse graphics. Weak experimental units. Gameplay consists primarily of unit churning and zerg tactics.

For those who enjoyed the similarities between TA and SC1 will be the biggest disappointment here. The economy of the previously mention games is utterly gone. No worrying about balancing energy usage and mass income with building and firing weapons, its all been removed. Its now a simple straight up, build up army, build base defenses, go conqueror enemy. Also gone are the tech levels, and weaker starting units, and teching up. Instead its replaced by research points that gradually come in much like all the other resources.  Without that element nothing really stood out in the game. Without the challenging economy, the campaign portion of the game becomes simple, build defenses, build army, repair defenses occasionally, attack enemy. Musically nothing really stood out, there may of been a couple times when I stopped to notice it, but again nothing inspiring. Storyline it also seems kinda lacking, it comes off like a Final Fantasy storyline mashed into brief conversations between 18 missions. There just simply is not enough there to make a great story, which once again left me greatly disappointed. Graphically the game was nice, and the small scale compared to SC1, meant I could actually stay somewhat zoomed in, to actually see the units, and not just commanding by click on the small icons. The movies were decent, just way to few of em to tell a good story. The game controls fairly well, being rather simple game now, its easy to pick up and get right into. Those with SC1 knowledge will have no trouble picking it up, as the mechanics are still basically identical to the first. Those used to Starcraft or C&C type games might take a bit longer but overall its not a hard game to get into or to start playing. The game probably has some strengths in multiplayer, as the unit balance does seem good, but I have not done any of that yet. Overall SC2 is not a bad game, everything seems to work, the game loaded smoothly, the game had no noticle lag, or slowdowns, but there is just nothing in it that simply makes it stand out. The game itself was fun to play through, and I did enjoy the limited story, and I may still by the sequel when it comes out (of course the ending had a cliff hanger for a sequel... what game doesn't do that no a days) yet this probably won't be a game I will touch all to often again now that I have beaten it. My suggestion is wait for the price to drop on this one if you simply want to see the continued storyline from the first, as the game offers very little of anything else to draw players away from other games.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,1,1,11 years ago,,3.0,3.4091,22,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10075055%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=10,15250436,fe7d8b34-e569-5186-8dce-57c70a13d88c,2022-01-16T16:18:00

Then Supreme Commander 2; What the hell happened here? You took almost everything that made the first two stand alone and dominate and tossed it out the window. My only guess is you tried to dumb this game down to the likes of a C&C or a Craft game so it could appeal to the zerg boys.... probably thanks to Square's involvement. Really Chris Taylor how much did it cost to convince you to kill your baby?! Graphics went from sci-fi futuristic to cartoonish. Threw out the unique resource allocation and made it a click and buy system with a ""Research"" resource which is another Craft game move that sucks. Took out almost 60% of the different units in the game an dumbed base creation and defense down to arrow towers CRAFT again!. All the maps appear to be zerg/rush maps. Threw out the tier system...

On almost everything else it's completely revamped. Upgrading has been replaced with ""Researching"", which really adds more hassle to the game, but also adds a new era of customization because instead of just going up levels 1, 2, 3, and Experimental, you can have multiple branches of different customizations, depending on your favored style of play. You can even simply upgrade what units you have instead of the old ""send oldies to suicide to make room for the new guys"" strategy. Actually, it is BETTER to keep the oldies instead of suiciding them, because the longer they stay on the battlefield, the deadlier they become thanks to experience now. The much-famed and even moreso whined-about economy that made SupCom 1 and Forged Alliance so famous (or infamous, lol) has been DRASTICALLY simplified, which on one side makes the game easier to play and a lot less worrisome, but on the other side it makes the game harder because now you can no longer make/build units/structures without first having the resources available, instead of just having that drastic omni-slowdown from the first two. The epic battlefields of the first two games are... well.. gone... No more will you have the massive wave upon wave of units swarming towards your opponent across miles of territory, because they'll now practically be right at your back door. Or front door, side door, or wherever they are positioned on the map. That's one drawback, but makes for much more interesting, heated, and faster-paced battles. The graphics are OUTSTANDING. So detailed you can almost see the individual bolts and weld lines on your ACU in close-up mode. And no more resource-clogging like FA was notorious for, the game runs smooth as silk if you have good enough graphics cards. (My dual ATI ASUS EAH4860s can barely run FA smoothly on even low graphics, but they effortlessly controlled SC2 on the highest graphics settings) I haven't gotten too far into the storyline yet, but it seems to be good so far. You actually play named characters in this game, instead of the generic ""Commander"" of the other two. It looks like an interesting storyline, and the voice acting is decent. The voices fit the characters. All-in-all, this game is not it's brothers, it doesn't have that epic scale quality to it, nor the complexity of the resource system (that complexity is now embedded in the Research system). It's beautifully redone and expertly made, I just wish they could have increased the epic scales to keep with SupCom tradition.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,11 years ago,,5.0,3.4091,22,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10075055%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=10,15250435,5a98f35c-d61e-5b55-b274-6a97c6f6ef27,2022-01-16T16:18:00

Most of the cons I've found so far are, requiring steam, the smaller battlefields, and other minor problems which may be fixed eventually in updates. It lacks the feeling of the original game but its still fun to play I'd recommend to everyone that they try the demo on steam first before deciding.

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/pc-games/products/supreme-commander-2/10075055.html,Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,522023,Androl123,Sooooo disapointing,"First off, you need to have Steam installed on your computer. Thanks for the heads-up on this Square. You buy a hard copy of the game but then have to log in to Steam to download it from their servers.....really? Some people are showing a 9 hour wait time to be able to play. Again, really? Second, they destroyed the economy and the basic gameplay of the original game and its expansion. None of it even matters any more. Its just a zerg fest. Most people think its due to the console being added to this title and thereby attempting to expand their market. They broke what made the first game such a huge hit. Gone are the days of epic battles for my 3rd point. Maps are now 5kmx5km. WAY too small. Fourth, you can't save/load in skirmish play. Soooo, if you have to leave in the middle of a longer lasting game (not real sure how this will happen being that everything is so small-but want to give them the benefit of the doubt for future content added updates), too bad. Can't save. Fifth, the voice acting and story line for the campaign is just plain stupid. I guess I could go on but I'm sure I've expressed my opinion enough for folks to understand where I'm coming from. This is just insulting to people who have been really looking forward to this title. There was a reason the first game was as much of a success as it was. Well, Square Enix effectively threw that out the window and scrapped it all.

Out of the box it had a firmware update. and then a week later another.  the 2nd was a bit rude, as it occurred in the middle of a show without warning.
I am using the amazing OLED with a brand new 4k reciever with eARC.  So everying goes through the Amplifiter through a high end HDMI ARC certified cable to the TV's HDMI 1 (eArc).  Most days its running fantastic and smooth as expected.  Although, the TV has 2 behaviors that need adjusting, not sure if its me or a firmware update.  They are: the screen goes blank when new input isnt supplied, ie your movie is paused. And you need to press the OK on the remote to wake it up.  Having your show resume, doesnt do it.  and the 2nd is that a few times now, the TV just doesnt see any input on HDMI 1, when clearly the Amplifier is sending signal.  Looking forward to a future firmware to make this TV absolutely perfect!",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,1 year ago,,5.0,4.2727,363,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11180293%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=210,227308429,9bd8d11d-12c7-5078-8ffd-a76aad22839c,2022-01-16T16:18:02

The picture quality is amazing. The smart cast interface is solid, and it's all packeged under an beatable price. 

HOWEVER, there are a few headaches that is keeping me from recommending it, the first is the HDMI 2.1 port. The OLED h-1 has 4 HDMI ports, #1 is eARC (awesome), #4 is a regular 2.0 (works for most devices you want to plug in to get 1080p or 4k), BUT port #2 and #4 are the new HDMI2.1-120hz ports, and they are currently practically USELESS if you want to get 4K and Dolby 5.1 on them. They are currently not compatible with the PlayStation 5, and it is super buggy with the new Google Chromecast with Google TV. It will not get 5.1 audio with the new Chromecast, and to get 4K, I have to manually switch the input from Auto to 1.4, then back to 2.1. This is very frustrating. 

This is still a really good TV. But the growing pains right now would keep me from recommending it to others.

I like that this is wireless with sensors , so I'm not tied down with a cord.

The motion controls are awesome, this is a smart product!

This has a design that feels good in the hands, it is not bulky or hard to work.  

My nephews prefer this over the other wireless controller we have, and they kind of fight over it.

The controls are tight and the yoshis are as adorable as ever.

The addition of being allowed to manually aim your eggs removes some of the frustration that earlier titles had and there are collectible items in abundance for completionists. That all said, the game is not meant for those looking for a challenge. I don't need dark souls levels of difficulty, but at least some sort of resistance would have been nice. Levels can basically be run through rather blind if you're not hunting for every red coin or flower. Even the challenge levels at the end of the game don't really have much bite to them.

The biggest hiccup in the game I think is the mini quests you get. Each level has multiple different set pieces that a robot will want you to collect. The issue is you can only do one at a time so the game asks you to play through one level at least 6 or 7 times and it can get rather tedious at times. My suggestion is that if you are collecting everything, don't try to get it all at once because I assure you you will be back through that level multiple times.

In the end the game is a relaxing adventure through a handcrafted (Almost literally) world that never fails to charm. Perfect for players of all ages, but if you're looking for a challenge I would look elsewhere.",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,1,0,2 years ago,,4.0,4.6556,2390,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10161220%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=410,126289526,512efb41-f0b9-5a8b-ac21-e6f988f04a2d,2022-01-16T16:18:05

Vizio has a reputable name so of course I wanted to give the oled a try. Day one when I got the tv home it wouldn’t power up. So after plugging the tv up and unplugging it a few times I got it to power up. The oled does have a beautiful picture but now every morning when I want to turn on the tv it won’t power up again. I have to unplug the tv for 30 minutes EVERY morning for it to come on now. While I’m watching tv the sound just goes away at times and I have to reboot the tv sometimes 3 times before the sound comes back on. At times the hdmi won’t recognize it has the cable or game system connected so I have to turn it off and on again when that happens. This is just unacceptable from vizio. I hear there will be firmware updates but how long will that take?  I don’t know what to do should I return the tv and try another vizio oled or just stay clear of vizio because this is the beat quality they can produce right now,No: I don’t recommend this product,,0,0,1 year ago,,1.0,4.2727,363,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11180293%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=250,226704721,2cd61b63-9d87-5b31-a9f0-29eb39dc6df2,2022-01-16T16:18:05

You have to manually change the input setting from HDMI AUTO to HDMI 2.1 for the Xbox to recognize the 4K @ 120hz. If that wasn’t annoying enough the specs said ALLM, HDR, and VRR. When you go to the TV info screen says no to HDR and VRR. Then proceeded to give the TV another chance by using the apps it offers. What a joke! The screen went green and kept flashing the picture. I tried five to six apps. All the same outcome. Finally on day three of owning it... it quit showing the picture for the Xbox. To confirm it wasn’t the Xbox Series X I switched back to my Samsung Q70R TV which has a better picture and does everything, but 4K @ 120hz abs is still to this day running fine.

The only issue that kept me from giving it a five star rating was the software and intuitive control. Not too snappy or fast enough but is workable. Doesn’t let other apps to be added like ESPN and so forth. Also there is an issue with hdmi port 4. I tried adding a fire stick to this port and it will not pick up the signal. The stick doesn’t fit on the other three ports in the back. But as far as the picture quality is right up there with the other OLED television from other competitors. For the Black Friday price I paid in comparison to the competition it cannot be beat. No remorse whatsoever on that. Also the picture quality is excellent. Some calibration maybe required for those videophile fans like myself. But is an excellent choice if you can live with the small glitches I mentioned. Oh the remote should have been upgraded.

The OLED screen looks amazing, but I have had so many bugs and quirks. Almost every other day the TV just won't turn on.  The power button on the TV won't turn it on and the remote won't turn it on. When this happens I have to unplug the TV and replug it in. There have also been so many bugs with it working with my Xbox Series X and PS5. The new HDMI 2.1 ports just don't currently work with the PS5 at all. You literally can't get a picture from the PS5 if you use those ports. They do work for the Xbox, but VRR doesn't work correctly. The TV also just stops recognizing the Xbox sometimes. I have to unplug the HDMI cord and plug it back in when this happens. I have had some weird color issues on the border of my screen, I think this is due to the""pixel shift"" option to help reduce burn-in. If I go into the settings and power cycle the TV then the picture is in the correct position and the color on the border of the screen is corrected. I have to do this almost every time I use this.

I have watched movies and the picture quality for that is awesome. Just watching and streaming content is generally amazing. If that is all you want to do then this will be fine, but DO NOT buy this for gaming right now.

The story line is as childish as the other Yoshi games prior. However, when you consider that the whole premise is set from the perspective of a Yoshi who is still technically a baby/child at this time it becomes easy to understand how primitive their mind works and forgive the innocence of a basic story line. The game is very easy to play but the environment makes for a challenge. If you have played Yoshi's Story for N64 or Yoshi's Wooly World it is very similar to the side scroller you know and love but the difference is being able to reverse the levels and access items from afar by shooting eggs. Still a long way to go in this game myself, personally so I cannot give it the ending a review but it is worth a play through in my opinion from what I have seen so far.

Two of us were able to set it up and did not have any damage. They have stickers on where to not hold and to hold that do help. A small issue with the TV is that it goes dark after a very short period of time, we figure we can adjust this, however, it is annoying that the Chromecast cannot turn on the TV. The show may start playing, but you have to find the remote to turn the TV on if it was off.

At first, the HDMI slots were giving a grainy picture that did nothing on screen so I had to unplug the TV and start again. Even at times switching between sources would put the TV in a hiccup and would not respond to any commands...unplug and start again.

Audio was a problem too as when turning on the tv the audio for my cable source wouldn't even be acknowledged. Had to switch to PS5 then back a couple of times before it would work. If not....unplug and start again.

it became annoying having to unplug the tv if I had a problem, which made me rethink my purchase.  But I have a friend who also bought the same model and advised me to keep my eyes open on Reddit.com for any work arounds. Sure enough, some other users had to  workarounds for the tv and BOOM! This thing is looking gorgeous, PS5 runs smoothly, the audio has no problems.

My wife says this OLED is brighter than that TV and I think she's right. I was worried about OLED brightness after watching reviews on YouTube, but clearly the screen is bright, just not as bright as more modern LEDs, which are, in reality, blindingly bright after seeing those at the store. I prefer this over the sunlamps that are modern LEDs. 

We watch Hulu, Prime, Netflix and have our Plex server. The smart system was able to completely replace our Fire Stick as all of those apps are included in the system. 

OLED blacks are simply amazing... seeing the Star Wars logo hovering there in perfect blackness is just amazing to witness. I practically bought this TV just to see that.

However, the Fire Stick itself highlighted my only gripe: The connector area is not that well designed. It's hides beautifully and the cable management is a delight.... but you can't easily fit a Fire Stick to this TV. It won't directly fit into any HDMI ports because either the stick is too large to fit in the area or the plastic of the TV prevents it from going down all the way. My fire stick has the ethernet adapter so in order to plug it into to the TV you have to use the Fire Sticks 3 inch HDMI cable and you can't close the cable management panels, ever. It's moot for me because I've got a very clean install now, but still that area could be bigger and more accessible.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,1 year ago,,5.0,4.2727,363,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11180293%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=310,226415742,2a4cd423-669d-5994-abf0-183013f83828,2022-01-16T16:18:08

I was debating on getting a QLED and am so happy I spent a little extra on this OLED, which was significantly cheaper than competitor models.

I replaced my 10 year old PLASMA with this VIZIO OLED and was fearful that while I was buying top technology, there were specs I would miss from the PLASMA (tech they dont make anymore). I was wrong. Everything looks better. Video games, movies, even non-4k TV. Not only is this a fantastic TV but it successfully upgrades my family room from the Plasma. 

Watching 4k movies from a 4k bluray player is simply amazing. It's a cinematic experience.  I have a Playstation 4 that while only regular HD, looks significantly better on this OLED.  Bright and Crisp beyond what I thought it would be able to do.

Three small non-perfect items (that hopefully an update fixes):
1 - the apps available are limited to streaming subscription services. It's missing HBO / HBO MAX as well as almost all live TV apps (MLB, FOX NOW, etc). I had to buy a ROKU stick for the back of this TV to compensate.
2 - the input shuffle lasts for a split second. If you have inputs (Cable/Sound receiver, Roku, Video Game, etc) the input screen only stays up for a few seconds so if you need to time to read you are out of luck. I have to toggle selections just to keep the menu option open so I can then read where I am and select what I need.
3 - The remote has some nice buttons specifically for a few streaming apps (Netflix, Vudu, etc). However, one of these button is REDBOX.  WHAT!?  something i have never used nor will ever use. It would be amazing if you could customize the shortcut buttons (And then swap out which ones you place)

OVERALL this is a fantastic TV, I can't simply say enough how terrific the quality is.

Picture was pristine.  Movies look fantastic.  Audio passthrough works perfectly, passing PCM, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus (all my amp supports) automatically switching on the fly.  TV looks great, love center stands. Smartcast works great, apps are stable, speed is good.
CONs:Software.  This is beta software by any definition.  The Luminance setting allows you to change it, but switching inputs, it shows the number you set but the actual luminance reverts to the TVs default.  Other settings fail to remember where they are supposed to be.   I am not a gamer, but VRR does not work.  4K@120hz actually drops every other frame so you end up with 4K@60.  Input lag is high for TV advertised as a gamer monitor.  Most all the CONS should be fixed in firmware updates, but for now, consider this a beta unit.

I bought the original Xbox the week it came out and never looked back. I wound up with four 360's (my original white 20GB model red-ringed twice but I also have the MW2, MW3, and Reach consoles). Graduated to an original XB1 after the 360, got an XB1X for the 4K, and now have the XBSX. This controller embodies the whole life span of the XBox. I love the 20th anniversary logo and translucent look. The black surrounding the green X on the guide button lights up bright white and looks great. I got two Carbon Black controllers with my Series X, so I traded in one for this controller. My favorite part of the controller is the rubberized grips. I already liked the textured grips on the newest controllers, but the combination of rubber and texture really keeps this controller in your hand. I always use regular batteries in my controllers, but Razer makes a matching controller charging stand that includes a battery pack and cover and it looks as good as this controller so I am considering purchasing that as well.",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,2,0,3 days ago,,5.0,4.7707,157,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11157417%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=0,198511183,75013395-e301-5580-b395-16032296e6a5,2022-01-16T16:18:09

But it's a perfectly serviceable SOS game; pretty fun, addicting even, but doesn't go out of it's way to be anything spectacular. The character portraits are great, but the 3D models are sub par. The gameplay is fun and gives you plenty to do and unlock, but the Fatigue animations have no right being that long and often, and seems it was only put in there to pad out the game and/or annoy you. There are also issues of you getting stuck in your horse after you dismount, and getting blocked by villagers (you have to wiggle to get unstuck) which could've been avoided if they made the hitboxes a little smaller. As much as I criticize; I still get a lot of enjoyment out of it. I love taking care of my animals and wooing the bachelors/bachelorettes (the dialogue is cute and funny too).

I bought the OLED 55, to pair with the Elevate, in search of Atmos & Dolby Vision. What I found was very close to what I was looking for. 

What I’ve come to understand is that the technological requirements for implementing features like HDR/Vision & ATMOS/5.1.4 are complex and if you’re a little geeky like me, you’ll probably appreciate the granularity made possible by said complexity. Alternatively you may be frustrated by it. I was not deterred, but admittedly I was unprepared for what this device could do. For example, I had to update my HDMI cables (simple), but also come to terms with the dynamics involved with the features I was seeking (complex). The diversity of the audio visual ecosystem is real. But you probably already knew that. I think Vizio is handling it well. 

So far I only have 2 minor criticisms. 

One:  All the great features, for me at least, require near constant use of the app. I’ve used the app on iPhone 7 Plus, iPadOS, and the new iPhone 12 Pro Max. The app could use more refinement. It’s kinda-sorta slow on all devices and you have to scroll the adjustments kinda-sorta slowly to get them to register properly. 

The iOS app also presents different user interfaces, depending on what device I’m using it on, which you’d expect, but it’s not what you think... on iPad I see the same interface as the 7 Plus, so I’ve kept my old iPhone around because the remote interface on that device offers up way more features. On the 12, those features are several taps away, hidden behind menus for some reason. 

Two:  I purchased the Elevate first. And from the moment I powered up, I was experiencing static from the height speakers. So I updated my HDMI cables. And followed all troubleshooting online. The static persisted. Then I added this OLED TV thinking that my old TV was the obvious weak point. The static has persisted. I hope that I do not have an actual hardware problem, as I’ve successfully played Dolby V/A content directly from the TVs own apps (even then I heard static). So I will need to chat with support at some point.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,1 year ago,,4.0,4.2727,363,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11180293%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=320,226214412,f5a707a8-402c-53f8-a62d-ca7b3fe2e892,2022-01-16T16:18:09

The graphics in CW are superb. It amazes me how realistic and detailed every single thing is in this game! The levels are fun, but there’s not much challenge. It’s very easy to complete a level without taking any damage.

As with most Yoshi games, you still seek out the flowers, coins, etc in every level, but now there’s a hide and seek challenge with each world where you’re tasked to find hidden items in each level.

It looks great on my old Xbox One X and uses the HDR and VRR available there wonderfully.  However, as a PC monitor it becomes annoying quickly as it will dim or go completely dark frequently throughout the day.  Buried in the User Guide it says the TV will dim after 1 minute if it detects no change in the picture, and will go dark after 10 minutes, and there is no way to override that.  It is difficult to read a page of a document in less than a minute, especially when so much is visible on the large screen.  I was able to fix the dimming by using a slideshow as my desktop background that refreshes every minute, but it only works if some of the desktop is always visible.  Also, sometimes it goes dark even while I am typing on a window on the TV when it never dimmed first, requiring a remote click.  This only happens when using my PC, not my Xbox or with the built in apps.

It all feels pretty generic. The control scheme is a bit tricky, too, and it took a little while to get used to it. The game includes things like lock picking, wirecutting, and things of that nature, but it just doesn't have the lasting appeal.

The combat was clunky and lack luster as well. I played through the first few levels and then shut it off and traded it out for Watch Dogs. At least I got my moneys worth from that game!

So games have been part of my entire life. I don't want people to think I am just bashing a game as a first time game-player. The previews of this game looked amazing but once you play it all you do is sneak in shadows and loot cabinets. Literally thats all you do. You will also get an uncontrolable avatar that jumps from sneak point to sneak point. It is very annoying especially when you are trying to go undetected. It is also not a free roaming game as most of us define free roaming. I could deal with the no free roaming, bad sound track, and poor story if you did a bit more than just loot people houses.

It's like they took the antiquated gameplay from over a decade ago, and just updated the graphics. The mechanics and overall feel of the game are as if the developers had never even heard of games like Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, Hitman, or Dishonored. The world isn't very open, paths to take are quite linear, and loading screens before each new area completely destroy any effort they made to be immersive. I found the audio to be frequently quite aggravating, as guards tend to mindlessly repeat the same handful of phrases, and the volume doesn't seem to vary well with distance - so even if a guard is on the other side of the room, he's just as loud as if he were standing right next to you. Shadows are not always well defined, and object interaction is limited and repetitive. So you get no real sense of depth.

The Things that i really enjoyed was how they incorporated the use of shadows. So I thought that was very cool. The game play can be a bit stiff but it can get very intense at times as well. It feels the creators of this game did not put much effort into this game. The sounds are ok. And I'm not really feeling any emotion of the characters. And the running and the jumping is only one button... i like to control everything on a character especially a first person game. the guards all look the same. the fighting is quite lame. it literally makes you to just use your bow. and the knock out is simply a hit to the head... every single time. IT gets very boring and repetitive.

Thief is one of the best games I have ever played because I have also loved stealthy parts in video games and when I play online against other people in first person shooters, I was always the stealthy/tactical player. The story-line and gameplay for this game is just superb. Graphics are amazing and so it the sound quality. Just love the stealthy aspect about the game going around, hiding in the shadows, using my blackjack, shooting my bow, and most importantly... stealing haha. A game like Thief is so rare now these days. A game that requires strategy, patience, maturity, intelligence, and most importantly..... stealth skills.

But quickly realized it wasn't what I expected and I got bored fast. All the game is about is being sneaky and trying to avoid combat. Let me tell you this gets old quick. I'm on chapter 5 and I can't sit down and play this game for hours on in because it's the same thing almost always. Sneak and steal sneak and knock a guy out rinse and repeat. The dialogue isn't that great either. One good thing I can say about this game is the environment looks pretty cool and some of the music during some scenarios are fitting. The game isn't terrible but it's far from great. It's good for 1 play through but nothing more.

This game has a lasting appeal. I knew I would want to try Thief since I played Tomb Raider by the same people. I love the graphics, sound of the city and the massive map. You can go anywhere on the map and play the objectives as you see best. You have three options on every objective to either be a ghost, opportunist, or a predator. With completing the objective you are rewarded if you meet the assignments according to what option you have choose. The game tracks your actions to how you react with the surrounding environment thus it determines which option (ghost, opportunist, or predator) you have chosen to become. The sounds of the city are as real as you could imagine. There are so many ways to play this game and so many decisions to make as you make your way through the city trying to steal everything you can. It is in first person, I normally do not like that, but I do enjoy it with this game.

There are some minor problems with this which I can deal with but when you add them up it starts to feel like they just didn't care about the franchise that they were making. (1) The voice acting in the cutscenes was average but when half of the times the lips and the voice move off key and it looks like a English dubbed Chinese movie. (2) The characters in the story are so boring they have no appeal to the story and they are very forgetful. (3) the load point between parts of the city were stupid crawling in between boxes and lifting a log at the end was to generic they could of changed up the animation to different parts. P.s also I've only ever had motion sickness once in gears of war franchise when you run, and this game was making me sick I had to play in 1 hour runs. did this happen to anyone else?

Ryse and Tomb Raider kept me satisfied. Thief was gonna be better Right>? I mean it was gonna be Epic>...........Wrong.....Controlling Garrett is like controlling a dog on a leash who doesn't want to go in the same direction. The combat is awkward. Garrett is very limited in space. There is a white flash that crosses your vision repeatedly (I do not know why). I was bored within the first mission. The controls are sloppy and NOT user friendly. This game has been the biggest epic fail in my gaming career. I am 34 years old and have been playing for a long time. I now have a game and guide that are useless. I could go on and on in a more inappropiate manner but, I will not.

The stealth mechanics are excellent, some of the best I have experienced. The graphics and overall game play, however, are not very good at all. This feels like a PC game, not an XBox One (console) game. Climbing and jumping down are horrible. You can never really tell when you are able to jump down off of a ledge and often you simply can't. Stealing things is often an exercise in patience, as you (slowly) open a cabinet, (slowly) pick up a goblet, and (slowly) close the door again. Try doing that before the guard returns and more often than not, you don't. Voices are often disembodied, or worse, come from the wrong direction. I finished the first two chapters without even discovering where to purchase (or craft) arrows that I need to stealth properly. This is the kind of game that you either like or don't. If you do, then more power to you. If you don't, then faults abound. Looks like I will add this to the shelf of ""rainy day"" games when I am bored out of my skull.

I have completed the game and I have many issues about it. One is that the game boasts about choice but 99% of it doesn't differ from pressing X to continue. The choices you have have the same outcome or response but the description makes a big boast about how your decisions matter. The illusion of choice but extremely obvious it doesn't matter. 

For example, you get something like ""What should we do boss? ""

> let's save her mom
> we came here to meet her mom. 

PLOT HOLES EVERYWHERE! This game should be avoided at all cost if you believe common sense should exist. The game forgets its own mechanics when major events occur. Why would one try to attempt sacrifice so save someone at low hp when the skills: extreme healing shots, self healing, invulnerable block, and free dodging skill exists. Brilliant. 

Some fights or adventures are cut short even if you're doing extremely well, also you'll be shown with a single pistol and weak so you'll fit their plot line. 

You become a leader, but have zero leader choices. Makes absolutely no impact to the game even though they make a big commotion about it. 

The conversations and emotions are comparable to Jr high level. Everyone must be hormonal in order to think and act like they do here. All of which your single dialog choice (appears as two) has no impact and is barely better than one what you hear from the main cast. 

AI is horrific and can throw sticky grenades, knives, ect through walls with perfect accuracy. Be ready for an extremely unfair fights. So I hope you're ready to cheese some conflicts. 

Dodging mechanic can make dark souls experts cry. When you crouch your movement is either extremely slow or a forced stop of the trigger is pulled. You cannot move while firing crouched. Well, when you roll you are forced into a crouch at the end. You can try to roll again with the same result or jump out of it. This dodge doesn't work well on many attacks. 

Dialog and development choices are very poor. 
-8-10 cut scenes when they try to redo a boss fight? 
-confusing weapon modification and dungeon warp system. 
- have a single discussion between party members on quests that repeats every 5 minutes
-""enemy players"" have rediculous accuracy and damage. 
- unable to change weapons, skills, level up, or purchase bullets on quests. You must return to do any of this. Due to this, of you equip a new type weapon and go on a mission, you will likely have to restart when you find you have zero ammo and no notification of this. 
-players jumping and grappling are extremely clunky. 
-if you wish to do any meaningful side content you must restart the game to get to it. 
-story is more about your partner, kirito & friends, and your partner. I recognize I said that twice but that's how much it focuses on. You have a throw away character with essentially no meaningful impact on the game. 
-all throwable tools are hard to aim with! Fixed distance and can't aim up or down. 

Pros:
I loved the character creator. 

Game is more forgiving with deaths compared to previous Sao games. You keep all you've collected including exp and credits. 

Subquest and bounties speed up process as they can be redone and are flexible. 

Falling off a cliff removes very little hp and teleports you back. However this would happen less if the grabble and jump wernt horrible.

Original voices and subtitles! However there's no English audio. So there's no choice.

Customizable controls. 

Loot system is nice. 

Customizable partner is amazing.

Combat isn't bad sometimes. Skills are fun.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,1,0,2 years ago,,1.0,4.4221,244,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10152788%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=10,130489110,e2675e54-feb9-58c1-a00a-25032a04762b,2022-01-16T16:18:20

If you like anime/jrpgs anything like that you will have a great time as long as your stick through the intro. The intro is very spoon fed which was off putting for me since I usually play jrpgs and the like so it felt very basic and the tutorial/explanations were somewhat slow to me since I already felt like I understood about the game already. Overall the game play is fluid (I play on a ps4 pro) I haven't experienced any glitching, lag or otherwise poor performance. The game is fun, there's a lot of content and a lot of innerworkings that keep it challenging as well as interesting (character customizations are in depth and fun, as well as how you can play with character builds, skill/gadget sets, and modify and enhance weapons) not to mention there's a ton of dlc that really adds a substantial amount of gametime.

Everything is there that I wanted, and a bit more! Audio is great. Headset is more than comfortable and easily allows for hours of continuous usage. There are a lot of controls for listening either game v. chat and also overall volume. I really like the wireless feature of it. I have not had any problems with delayed sound. It really allows me to be free while I game and lets me stretch or move in a situation. The mic is one of my favorites. It is auto-locked/designed to be a certain distance from a person's mouth but in the time when a person wants to produce the artificial gargling trash talk when the mic is up close, it does bend to an extent (obviously don't break it by bending it too much, it is plastic but not flexible like some other mics). One of the best touches of the mic is the small sound indicator as to whether or not it is on or off. Definitely saved me in times where I just want to rage by myself. The charging cable is the same for a controller so no big deal. One slight disadvantage is the requirement to make the headset wireless. The ""box"" that is needed to connect device to headset uses a usb cord. I play on ps4 so I have to hook it up in the back and then have my controller charging cord in the front. While this is not a horrible dilemma it is mildly inconvenient at times and I thought it should be something that needed to be addressed.

I have played previous installments in the franchise and this one is the best so far. Still needs a bit of improvement but good. A positive thus far is the AI controlled teammates aren't too bad, I have seen much worse. Graphics are good, story line is interesting, character development is pretty straight forward, and there is a decent amount of customization. That said some big negatives is weapon selection can be a little limited, types of enemies is very limited and repetitive, and overall game play could use some improvements to bring in more in line with similar games in the genre.

The handle is heavier than what I expected, it provides weight and feels more realistic than plastic feels. I love the effect of the colored orbs that run through with each swish or button push and when it makes contact the sound effects match what I’ve come to expect from the movies. The three blades securely fit into the fasteners and are very sturdy, it really is a well made piece of equipment. I am not very happy with the stand, while it does a nice job of presenting the lightsaber forward and at a tilt, it isn’t completely sturdy. As a fan, I definitely love to have this on display but I do worry about it falling. I also feel that batteries should have been included.

I definitely love how the hilt is real metal and feels like how a lightsaber would actually feel. The main blade itself is fantasic and how it has LED’s inside of it. The side blades, however, are a bit lackluster. You can see the led strips through the side blades, which is only a minor fault. Also, the assembly itself is a bit difficult in understanding how to correctly screw the blades in correctly.

It is very realistic it looks just like the real thing from the movies. There's lots of red LEDs in all three blades on this saber so it lights up nice and bright. The handle on the sword is made of metal and has some weight on it so this lightsaber isn't flimsy or cheap looking it looks very realistic. The sword is powered by three AA batteries that don't come included. Installing the batteries was pretty easy you just unscrew the bottom of the handle and the batteries go right in there. There's two buttons on the sword's handle one is to turn the lightsaber on and off and the other is for the clashing sound effects. The lightsaber also comes with a nice metal stand so you can display the sword with or without the blades in if you wish. The first time we installed the blades into the sword's handle they were a bit tricky but after learning how they needed to be lined up and clicked in to lock them in place it was no trouble at all. Ever since this lightsaber arrived my husband can't stop playing with it. The clashing sound effects and the molten effects are really cool. It even looks really realistic the way it turns on. When you skin around and act like you're sword fighting the lightsaber makes sound effects and pulsates to make it look like you're really in a fight. I catch myself playing with it too because it is a lot of fun because it looks and feels so realistic. Any Star Wars fan or collector would love to have this displayed in their home it is a great conversation piece.,yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,2 years ago,https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86aGFzYnJvX2luYw/5b82602f-1f9d-5768-89d8-a7b3ee53c911~https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86aGFzYnJvX2luYw/26338836-685b-5a9c-99d4-3bfe1ca61150~https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86aGFzYnJvX2luYw/d534e921-e677-5384-9e71-a9f79beca356~https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86aGFzYnJvX2luYw/5a059e4d-2d32-5866-b4a7-fd902528a7cc,5.0,4.5952,42,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11049547%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=10,138046074,ff676beb-fbba-59b5-9516-73dfa267913d,2022-01-16T16:18:22

The over all weight is around 6 lbs and is made of extremely strong plastics and everything fits snuggly and securly into place so no wobbly pieces that might come off during role play.

The sound and light effects are terrific, too. You can have just the motion sounds when you're waving it around or a ""lava"" sound that pulses when at rest. The lights change when you come in contact with something (hopefully just pillows or the couch!) as do the sound effects at the same time.

Sure Kirito, Asuna, Shinon and the rest of the gang are here too of course, but it's not a shrine built to one character.
The controls are easy enough to get used to and the tutorial is very helpful and flexible. A bit long in the tooth. This is not the game to play on a tight schedule. The cut scenes will take time. I wish it were in English though.

All these kids talking in Japanese while I'm trying to read in English and all they talk about is playing a game within the game you're playing and meeting in real life.  There are some points where the story gets you amped up - a character says ""Hey!  I know where an awesome sniper rifle is!  Let's go get it"" and instead of you venturing forth to get it, it just continues to show you two talking then says something like ""Wow! that was a fun journey getting that sniper rifle!"" and.. that's it.  The ""dungeons"" are big square corridors where you fight 4 different robot-looking enemies.  A robot guy, a robot spider, a flying robot, and sometimes a boss.  In the regular world you fight different colored robot guys, scorpions, and bees.  Sometimes a sandworm and a robotech thing.   The movement is very smooth and the graphics are very nice.  I could have done without the two hours of dialogue in the beginning of the game.  I just wanted to shoot some stuff, but all everyone wanted to do was talk.  If you're a fan of the anime and spamming the shoot & reload buttons then I guess this is for you.  If you're looking for an RPG shooter with a story you can follow, I'd go someplace else.     OH!

I’ve played the regular Nintendo versions and most recently the 3ds re-releases. This felt like the best of both worlds. The better graphics while maintaining the traditional style felt seamless. The great story telling of Ocarina of Time mixed with nostalgic Hyrule of old. I wasn’t a fan of Majoras Mask and so far haven’t found much carry over into this version, which for me is a plus. It’s semi open world as you can roam on your own time completing side quest or tackle the main story utilizing the town and its people to solve riddles, mazes, and boss battles. The graphics still hold up in 2019 for my eyes at least. I’ve seen the new Links Awakening and while stunning, it’s not difficult to immerse myself back into this game. Dated graphics don’t distract from the game play like some 3ds games. The 3D helps with that as this is the only game I’ve been able to play with the 3D on the whole time without getting a headache.

The durability and the time between charges is day and night, the RIG’s 800HS are definitely the way to go, and make me enjoy having a wireless headset. Before I went wireless I was using the Hyper X plug into controller style. I went through 2 pair of them breaking the mute button, which on all 3 pair is a flip up and down design and the Astro 20’s the mixer box started to act up not allowing me to even turn the headset on and always needed to be charged but I also game a lot, about 5 hours a day or more and I have purchased and used all of these headset products within the last year and so I feel I definitely can give my honest opinion on which is the best and hands down it’s the.........RIG 800HS.  And definitely would recommend anyone to buy this product. Now the Hyper X plug n play are great buy for 50$ as long as you are very gentle with the flip up and down mic but the Astro 20 and RIG 800HS are about the same price point at 150$ and I say that there’s no comparison 800HS smash the Astro 20’s.

The puzzles are some of the best in the series with the ability to merge in and out walls and the new world of Lorule.

But Gamestop has a 30 day return policy so I figured if I didn't like them I could always bring them back.  5 days later and I still love these headphones.

Usually, that would be an indicator that they are of shoddy craftsmanship, quite the contrary. One pair is for me, the other two are for my wife and brother. As an audiophile who takes the sound quality of my videogames very seriously, the Plantronics RIG 800HS for the PS4 delivers a full package where even the first party Sony Platinum headset did not. In comparison, the RIG 800 HS provides a wider range of frequencies on both the low and high end of the sonic spectrum. If I can hear bow skipping techniques on a drop-tuned double bass, I am a very happy listener. Additionally, the visual confirmation with the boom microphone showing whether the listener is muted is more convenient than the one-tone button of the aforementioned Sony Platinum headphones. All of the typical buttons have been traded for an intuitive set of manual rotary dials which allow for master volume and mix between party chat and game audio. The addition of 4 built-in EQ settings is a great touch, and I find that the ""Seismic"" setting is more of a quality audio enhancer that a simple over-the-top ""bass boost"" like listening through Beats. I still have yet to run down the battery. The bragging point of an ""up-to-24-hour-battery-life"" seems well earned for gamers who find themselves a tad obsessed from time to time. The biggest selling point for me besides amazing sound? They breathe. The around-the-ear design uses a very comfortable perforated cloth and foam to allow for a maximum amount of breathing around one's ears. Pair that with it's incredibly light-weight design and it's almost like you're not wearing a headset at all.  It's a real shame that GameStop is throwing all of it's advertising money into promoting those mediocre Turtle Beach Recon 200's when they have these in their inventory. The Plantronics RIG 800HS are truly a superior set of headphones.",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,1,0,2 years ago,,5.0,4.4111,596,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10158714%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=120,124351245,1340e499-65f1-5ec8-8fed-26d2dc3abc8c,2022-01-16T16:18:27

As far as functionality, it doesn’t have much. The frame is just there to add visual appeal, but you really can only use it for the shelf space, which is small. It’s almost like it’s more of a decorative element to have the frame around it and that requires a lot of hardware in the wall to keep it secure.

The directions are clear and it’s easy to install. It just took a little extra time because you’re using heavy duty bolts that go into the wall.

With two minor issues.,"So I bought the Rig 800 HS headset a couple months ago. They’ve been really awesome no major complaints at all, they fit great comfortable to wear for extended hours of gaming on my PS4 (PUBG). The sounds are great and let you know where the enemy is firing from. The two super small issues I have with this headset, compared to my Rig 800 LX for my Xbox One S. The two minor issues is the the max volume on my 800 HS doesn’t feel as loud as my 800 LX. Along with that after really playing for a couple of hours some sounded really different. So I put the product boxes next to each other. And the Rig 800 HS so not have 3D surround sound. And that was a minor issue, but having months playing the 800 HS it is an issue but not a big or huge issue. But I am thoroughly pleased.

I purchased this headset because I broke the dongle to my wireless PlayStation Platinum headset. 

COMFORT
The Plantronics headset is far more comfortable than the PlayStation headset, it doesn’t even feel like I’m wearing them! PlayStation Platinum headset was too tight and would give me headaches because I have glasses. 

FEATURES
The microphone and speakers on both pairs were fair and about the same, however then PlayStation Platinum had better features that allows users to prioritize game/chat volume. Plantronics has a similar feature but it only changes the game volume and leaves the chat volume at the same level. 

BATTERY
When it comes to battery power, the Plantronics is far better. I, at times, play for up to 7 hours straight on a single charge and I’ve gotten zero low battery notifications from the Plantronics whereas the PlayStation Platinum will last me around 6 hours.",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,0,0,3 years ago,,5.0,4.4111,596,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10158714%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=190,118661574,986fa1e7-32c1-5925-8377-9833c75dd41b,2022-01-16T16:18:31

I've played all but three games, The first two (I don't have an NES) and Skyward Sword (I refuse to buy a Wii). A Link Between Worlds is only out ranked by Wind Waker, Ocarina of Time and maybe Minish Cap or Majora's Mask. I absolutely love the game. It is absolutely beautiful to look at, the sound track is amazing, the gameplay feels like the Minish Cap and I believe it will, or at least should, become a classic. However, it's not all good. There are two mechanics that I find interesting. First, is the 'wall merge' this is a cool little mechanic that allows you to merge into a wall for a short time. It's not that I don't like this mechanic, but it's integrated into a ton of puzzles and I have a tendency to forget about the more gimmicky mechanics like this which causes me to get stuck (even on my third play through). Second, is that you 'rent' most of you items. Now, this one really sucks. When you die you lose all of those items. But that is not the reason I hate this mechanic; the reason I hate this mechanic is that you never know just exactly what you're going to need in a dungeon. If it weren't for this mechanic Link Between Worlds would easily be my favorite game of all time; it is awful and should NEVER be put into another Zelda game.",yes: I recommend this product,,5,0,5 years ago,,4.0,4.6818,396,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10110062%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=90,62007788,dcb444d4-0319-5d07-bcc9-bd9a0f357bb7,2022-01-16T16:18:31

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/3ds/products/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds---nintendo-3ds/10110062.html,The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,605048,MajorSpoilers,The Legend of Zelda in its purest form.,"The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds embodies everything that the Zelda franchise is, and should be, in its purest form. I would call this THE definitive Zelda game, and the one that any fan of the franchise absolutely MUST play, if they want to maintain any level of credibility.

Zelda, before all else, is a game about exploration, and puzzles. Delving into caves and dungeons is the vision Miyamoto had when creating the first one, and has been the game's signature modus operandi for the last 27 years. ALBW is that, in its purest form. Unlike almost all previous Zelda games, this one offers you almost absolute freedom to you as far as your adventure's direction. Aside for the Sand Rod only being obtainable after you finish a certain dungeon, you are presented with all of Hyrule's dungeons at once, ready for your spirit of adventure to explore at any point in time.

While the story does suffer slightly for this, with no smooth progression throughout, gamers that don't absolutely require a constant narrative won't be put off by this fact. The underlying plot remains, with you rescuing/retrieving several Artifacts of Plot Progression +1, true to Zelda Style, upon whose collection, the story progresses accordingly. There is, unfortunately, very, very little character development of any sort, perhaps the single notable case being Ravio. While I am a sucker for character-driven gameplay, this game doesn't style itself as a character-driven game, and as such, cannot be faulted for this.

The second distinctive feature of Zelda gameplay is puzzles, and this is where ALBW bursts forth, outshining the rising sun and bestowing cinnamon tans upon gamers the world over. The puzzles in this game are easily the best that any Legend of Zelda game has seen. Ever. The game's core mechanic of turning into an image on a wall comes into use in every dungeon, and many places in the overworld. Sometimes it is used in obvious ways, and in others in such brilliant ways that, even though the game clearly requires the player to use them, one just can't help but pat themselves on the back, because it is just that satisfying.

Make no mistake, A Link Between Worlds makes you feel smart. The ultimate puzzle master, the likes of which Professor Layton would bow to! The game's numerous puzzle-solving items come in handy in a wide variety of ways, and are of a rather wide variety themselves. The devs showed some real creativity with some of them, while others are simply iconic to the Legend of Zelda series, such as the Hookshot and Bombs.

But this leads me to one of the game's few shortcomings: The Boomerang. Simply put, the thing is useless. EVERYTHING it can do, the hookshot can do better, and there is a grand total of ONE puzzle in the game (In an option mini-dungeon that leads to a stack of rupees, specifically) in which only the boomerang, and not the hookshot, will work. Truth be told, I think the Boomerang was only put into the game because of how iconic it is, and that irks me.

Other lackluster items would be the Sand Rod and Gust Stick, or whatever it was called. The two are extremely situational, but both have positive traits to outweigh their obsolescence. The Sand Rod, for one, makes for some INCREDIBLE strategies. While utterly useless in combat, and basically anywhere outside of the desert, the Sand Rod's function, and its ability to work in tandem with Link's imaging power made the Desert temple, hands down, the most interesting, fun, and fulfilling dungeon in the game. Sadly, the rod is of no use whatsoever after that, aside for retrieving one Maiamai in the village. After the Boomerang, I say this should be the last item you upgrade.

The Gust Stick, while bordering on useless as a puzzle item, is one of the best items in combat once upgraded. When empowered by the Mother Maiamai, it stuns anything within its (now greater) range, and I was surprised to find it probably the most useful weapon in the gauntlet on top of the Mountain.

Others often cite Ravio's lending and selling items as one of the game's faults, but when you set aside the frustration, you have to admit the system is brilliant. It's a punishment for death so that it's not just a slap on the hand, gives you a reason to save and economize those rupees you save up.

I can't emphasize enough just how fantastic a Zelda game this is. The only person I would not recommend this to would be one who only likes character and narrative-driven games .",yes: I recommend this product,,2,1,6 years ago,,5.0,4.6818,396,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10110062%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=100,51795339,1e9e21c7-edbc-5c4d-a9c5-3aaaf9e406ef,2022-01-16T16:18:32

This game utilizes the top-down perspective in ways I could've never thought possible, and the 3D is particularly stunning in this form. The mechanics of being able to merge into walls is a blast, and temporarily renders the perspective to something of 3D as I mentioned earlier (not to be confused with the 3D effects of the system itself). I'll admit this game is not as challenging as many past titles, but regardless it is a fun ride with enough references to A Link to the Past to make any Zelda veteran feel right at home. The open world concept gives a broader sense of freedom and exploration, which I love. My only complaint is the inability to connect across wifi for shadow battles. Streetpass is a cool feature, but I'll never understand why it seems to take priority over online features.

The plot for the game will keep you captivated throughout, with the final scene leading to the battle with the final boss presenting a huge plot twist.

It isn't what I was expecting. I'm an extreme Legend of Zelda fan, and I'm used to them having puzzles and challenges. I'm used to spending ages in a dungeon, trying to figure it out. I'm used to fighting tricky bosses. So far, this game has none of that. The dungeons are frustratingly easy; I finish them in half an hour. I haven't gotten stumped once, and the bosses have no chance against me. Fairy? Why would I need a fairy? I can kill a boss and barely be damaged. Actually, I beat a boss yesterday WITHOUT losing hearts. I like the new power this game brings, and I like the music, but that's about all I can say about it... I don't like the idea of renting items either because then what satisfaction do you have in solving a dungeon? I'm used to beating a dungeon, and then being excited because now I can go do some side mission with my new item! Not anymore. One more thing, what's this about having unlimited arrows and bombs? All I have a hope of getting from any chest or person is gold or a heart piece. I miss finally beating that mini-game and getting a bigger quiver! How fun it was. ~sighs~ I feel as if this game is geared towards children, and I'm, like I said, disappointed.

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/3ds/products/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds---nintendo-3ds/10110062.html,The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,605048,Jacobee,Almost perfect,"Though I’ve only thoroughly played and beaten two Zelda games, I am confident A Link Between Worlds will be remembered as a high point in the series. The game’s old-school Zelda style is significantly different from that of more modern titles, and it’s a truly triumphant return. The item collection aspect is surprisingly fun, helping to bolster the game’s somewhat weak post-story (more on that later). Perhaps the quest to obtain every last tool, weapon, and heart piece is so addictive because most, if not all, of the collectibles will contribute to your combat skills, and therefore each directly affects regular gameplay. This improvement of fighting capability is made sweeter by the StreetPass Shadow Link battles, which let the player battle AI representations of other people’s characters, complete with individual items and equipment. This feature, too, helps make the game last longer, though I wish there was a way to directly do battle with others.

The game’s graphics are good, and the use of the 3D effect is exemplary; it legitimately contributes to some parts’ visual quality. The soundtrack and sound effects are both great, also. Of particular quality are the Overworld themes of both Hyrule and Lorule. The story is good, and the characterization of Ravio, Princess Hilda, and Yuga is nicely executed (for a video game). The optional order of dungeon completion (in Lorule) was a nice addition, too. The combat system is simple yet effective, and though some Lorulean enemies are a bit overpowered, this should be mitigated by eventual health and weapon upgrades. And though some specific instances in the game felt a bit obscure as to how to progress, this can probably be attributed to my inaptitude at Zelda games. Rest assured, enough experimentation and exploration can generally solve most puzzles and problems.

The only real place wherein A Link Between Worlds falters is in lasting appeal. Though the aforementioned item collection is fun, the game could have used a better post-story. And by better post-story, I mean *a* post story. There is none. After beating the final boss, you’re reset to right before the showdown. This is very annoying to me, generating a perpetual feeling of incompleteness, even after the player has collected every last item. I understand that the way in which the story ends somewhat prevents a playable post-story, but I’m still disappointed. And though the StreetPass functionality is fun, and the challenge of scoring best times at the Treacherous Tower is an option, it’s hard to dedicate much time to perfecting myself in those mini-games. This is because, at its core, Zelda isn’t really a game that’s meant to be a competitive, “share-with-your-friends”-type experience. And the Second Quest isn’t very enticing either, with too little changed aspects to make it worth it. Still, A Link Between Worlds is an awesome game, and I would definitely recommend it if you’re a fan of the adventure genre.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,7 years ago,,4.0,4.6818,396,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10110062%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=110,38152629,59ada1a4-66cf-56f7-af82-49f91ff9db4d,2022-01-16T16:18:33

It had a perfect balance with retro gameplay and modern gameplay as well. I love the creativity with the portrait effect. The orchestrated music is so amazing. I love how in every situation it would switch the soundtrack constantly. There are lots of enjoyable mini games with nice rewards at the end. Of course, you can enjoy the adventure throughout the light/dark world in 3D. I'm glad that they took advantage with the 3D because it's like a cherry on top of a magnificent sundae. Now the only complain I have is that game isn't as challenging, or as difficult as other Zelda games. I didn't feel the urgency or the edge of the seat situation like I had with ""A Link to the Past"" or ""Ocarina of Time."" (especially on dungeons and boss battles.) But yet again that is why they added ""Hero Mode"" just for hardcore gamers like myself. To make a long story short... its a must buy!!

The graphics are very good with rich lighting and beatiful colors. In the first few seconds of gameplay you will see a bird flying over the large game world form right outside your house in the game. The game might have a top down view but it is still looks great with live time lighting and amazing things to see. Very smooth animation with great uses of motion blur to make it feel so real. The 3D adds a amazing pop between layers and turning in to a painting lts u see the simamatic view of the charecter models in 3D moving about as well as all the other objects around u from a different angle. Zelda is also a beautiful lady in this game.... I wish she was real.... Such a nice lady to.... Any way.... The sound effects are also great u can hear the birds, you can hear your sword cutting throw the air. And you can hear your own foot steps perficly in line as you walk or run throw the game world. The game takes a different apporch no longer are all the key idea's found in the games brilantly designed dungons but they u can now buy them from a friendly if not greedy merchant or rent them. How ever if u rent them and die he will take them back so this adds a punishment for death and makes u more teance. The combat is smooth and almost all your idea's have effect in it. The smooth animation and clashing of meadal sound effects. As well as some well designed bosses and a adivtive streetpass shadow Link duals make the combat surpisily enjoyible if not a bit sempictic and repetive compared to passed resent Zelda games. Each chearacter in the game has a great personilty as a part of the story and the story is full of lour and gives amazing context for futher Zelda games in the timeline like OOT and Major'as Mask. The story is meaningful and emotional at times it is inspirerd by some real world history and thouse who dig hard enogh will fine a amazing meaing in the games design both story and gameplay really make you feel like your own a adventure. How ever the open world is great and broght to life in a all new way its the same basic lay out as A Link to The Pass. This may bring back great memorys of one of 16 bit games finest express and it hold up today very well. But the lake of changes to the hub world did seem a little strange as many of the parts of history they draw from comes from differet arrows of roamen history ect. Yet the over world is not roamen or really changed to fix the story. It does not feel overly nastogic but its open world design is some what limmed my its roots. That said the story blow my mind as did the amazing puzzles in the all new doungons. Some puzzles have different ways to sove them and are all amazingly design to give u the amazing feeling of soving a great Zelda dougon. And if u get stuck you can go see the fortion teller or buy hints with play coins for a ghosts. The story and level design were so emotionaly powerful for me this game gets my full recomenation and 2013 game of the year! Buy it now! And follow me on Miiverse my Nintendo Net Work Id is 3DSFlo.

The amount of exploration and non-linearity that is contained within this game is perfect. I have never played a game that did exploration better.

The story is really entertaining and well scripted. The graphics cartoon-type, but who cares about that anyway? The music, right from TLoZ orchestra, beautiful.
This is the type of videogame that gets me right in front of the 3DS screen for hours, not only to figure out what to do in the dungeons, but also to explore the nostalgic Hyrule and its new secrets, and of course the new Lorule with all its crazy inhabitants.
Another thing I also liked from this game is the fact that is not linear at all. I mean, in other Zelda games you have to go from an specific dungeon to another specific dungeon, but in this one you can go in the order you want. Its a small, but very notable change... at least for me.
If I had to take a favorite character from this game (just this game), its would probably be Ravio. Not because is (spoiler) Link's counterpart (/spoiler), but because he's some funny looking and acting guy. And that Ravio's shop was also a new and kinda frustrating thing (fighting enemies all day for some cash, woo!).
Also he talks. 'Nuff said.

I beat the whole thing in less than a week of mostly casual play; my job had kept me pretty busy that week, so I had mostly only been able to play during lunch breaks and such. I also was not a big fan of the weapon rentals. While I liked the Ravio character, the game kind of lost something, to me, when I could walk around with nearly every weapon after only the second or third dungeon. And it takes away some from the dungeon's sense of accomplishment when you're not finding and discovering the items in each dungeon. Beyond that, yeah the graphics were nifty and storyline was good.

In both of those titles, you have different protagonists with their own storyline but each time into the overall story and each decision you make for the most part determines the outcome of their own ar to be honest, I really enjoyed Detroit become human, and heavy rain. In both of those titles, you have different protagonists with their own storyline but each time into the overall story and each decision you make for the most part determines the outcome of their own arcs.  While flawed,  these two games are enjoyable and the results are mostly satisfying, the characters evoke strong emotions and it makes some of the odd pacing of the games worth it.  Beyond Two Souls, however, is very confusing.  The controls are awful. The story is convoluted. The characters are for the most part very unlikable.  The first two games mentioned have an overall satisfying reward, despite what ending you get. And beyond to souls, your endings are mostly the same, you get to choose between two options. A lot of your decisions don’t really matter. This is the lesser title of the three. That being said, I think that heavy rain and Detroit become human are both excellent quantic dream titles and therefore it’s worth it to get the collection just so you can play those two.

The bits and pieces of information you can gather early in the game are really intriguing, which made me eager to plow ahead.  But after trying (and failing) the first boss fight 40 or 50 times, it's just not worth it.  I tried the boss solo 10-15 times, and with two others another 30 times or so.  Never got more than about halfway.  Explosive enemies just pop up out of nowhere, with virtually no warning, every few minutes.  I don't understand these games that think ""difficulty"" equals ""fun"" (or ""good"").  It's just absurd.  Considering how many games are available (and fun), it just wasn't worth it to keep pounding my head against the wall.",No: I don’t recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,6,16,1 year ago,,2.0,3.8,35,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11100415%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=0,160834495,667fcebf-0015-543a-ae30-ba2c34b043a4,2022-01-16T16:18:35

When the day finally came, I traded two games towards this. I played it, and I was having a good time. Five days after release, I finished it. I couldn't believe how easy it was. For crying out loud Nintendo, first Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon was too easy and short, and now a ZELDA title?! Where are the development masters from 1998? I honestly don't see why a bunch of people are rating it 10 out of 10. Oh, and did I mention that I beat it in less than 17 HOURS. AND I didn't use a strategy guide or ANY guide. The only reason I haven't gotten rid of it yet is because I want to try to finish the Hero Mode. It's very rage-activating, but that's Hero Mode. I think there's too many giveaways in the dungeons.

But what I wasn't expecting was that I would be so entranced by this game, to the point that I would be playing this game for hours on end. By far the best part about this game is its utilization of the 3D in such a beautiful way that, it makes you wonder why aren't all games in 3D. On to game play, I can see how the weapon rental system can get annoying, but I never died in the game so it was never really a bother to me. All of the dungeons are different from its SNES counterpart as to keep you interested in finding a way out. The games soundtrack is amazing. There is so little bad things to say about this game, but if I could say anything it would be two things. Due to the rental system, combat is too easy, you won't find that a boss has a specific weakness to a weapon usually, just your sword works most of the time. Two, also due to the rental system some of the dungeons seem less involved with the specific item needed to get to that dungeon, if I'm going to have to go back to Ravio to get a specific item, I'm going to want to use that item to its fullest.

Overall Gameplay: I really enjoyed playing this game with the new mechanic to transform into a moving painting really added a lot of creative ways to go about and move around through a dungeon. One thing I feel is the boss's were a tad bit easy but I didn't really mind it much solving the puzzles and getting through the dungeons using the new mechanic made up for it. Graphics: In my opinion what really makes the game look good is the art style It really makes this game pop some people might dislike the art style I personally love it. Sound: The music is what you could expect from a Zelda game amazing and relaxing and just EPIC. Sound effects in the game are also very good. Lasting Appeal: I myself have played through the game once and still exploring finding many different things I've missed along my journey. I also found myself testing out the streetpass battle system where you fight shadow link and earn rupee's this wont really add any lasting appeal just sort of a fun and easy way of earning money if you can defeat him. In the game there is also these dungeons where your goal is to get treasure by solving the puzzle I'm pretty positive there's no enemy's in these types of so called dungeons. The one mode that tops this off is Hero mode which you unlock after you beat the game the difficulty of the game is heightened I'm now just starting my play through of it from what I know I don't think much is changed except the difficulty of mobs and bosses and I believe you take much more damage per hit. Well I probably left a lot out but anyways I enjoyed this game and I hope other people will to!!!

Give it a chance.,"First off, it's a sequel to my favorite Zelda game, so it has a lot to live up to. I think this game is fantastic! Creative puzzles, fantastic music, tough boss battles, and the visuals are a great melding of old and new-school Zelda art styles. If you remember Link to the Past, running around Hyrule will send you on a great nostalgia trip. The item renting system initially bothered me, but I grew to enjoy it, as it allows you to complete the dungeons in any order you see fit. You can buy the weapons you rent for about 800 rupees (some for a little more), but you find money stashed in so many different places that this isn't a problem. There is even a cool upgrade system for the weapons and gear you accumulate. GIVE THE GAME A CHANCE before you complain about the changes made to the standard Zelda formula, as many are doing.

This game is GOLD. People need to stop complaining that the game is too ''easy'' or the dungeons are to ''easy''. Why don't people actually pay attention to the game play? The game has a unique and breathtaking experience. You can go IN walls, and walk while you are in one, to help you get places. In the dungeons, you need to merge into the walls and go to another corner to get to a platform, to get to some stairs that were out of reach before. There are also new weapons such as
- the sand rod
- the tornado rod
- the ice rod
and the fire rod.
The music is stunning, (in a good way) it is done by a different composer than previous Zelda games, but thankfully, they picked a good one. The Lasting appeal takes so long before it goes away. A lot of people have been saying this game is worse than previous Zelda games, that things have changed, but in my opinion, video games can't always be the same thing, over and over again, and that it IS good to change. Thats something that a lot of gamers don't get these days. Sometimes, video games need to be worth their color.

Here are 10 reasons why you must have this game. 1. Music- The soundtrack in this game is absolutely gorgeous. From epic tracks to soft tracks, this is one of the best sounding Zelda games. 2. The characters- In all Zelda games the characters you meet along your journey are always memorable, and this game is no exception. From the evil and sure of himself villain, to the princess of the dark kingdom of Lorule, all the way to the weird yet awesome shop keeper, you will find yourself truly connecting with the characters of this game in every sense. 3. The story- Though not deep enough to make you cry, the story throughout the game is fantastic and perfectly well paced. 4. Freedom in exploration- Over the years Zelda games have become very strict in the sense that you go to this dungeon an then that dungeon. In this new adventure you decide where you want to explore in any order you want. This brings me to the next reason; 5. New way to play- In this adventure instead of you getting key items in dungeons, you'll be able to get all of them for a high price soon after you begin your quest. This allows you to explore the land and solving puzzles at any time you would like to. 6. The action- Like all Zelda's you are Link with you sword, shield, and other weapons. This game is no exception with it's spot on gameplay that's as fun as heck to beat the enemies with. 7. Wall morning....or whatever it's called- In this installment you'll be able to ride along side the walls to get to places you never could in order to solve puzzles and find items. This adds a tremendous amount of new fun experiences to the game that I never felt before in any Zelda title. This new ability is truly unique 8. The puzzles- With every dungeon...there must be puzzles to keep you from moving forward, and this game has some of the best I've solved in a long time. Using your items, smarts, and new wall morphing ability, this game is packed with really fun, clever, and (only some) difficult puzzle solving. 9. I don't have a number 9 so let's move on to number 10. 10. Zelda- Let me remind you, this is a Legend of Zelda title.......WHY WOULDN'T YOU BUY IT!?!?!?!

For a game of 40 dollars I feel as if the cost of each entertainment hour is not matched. The rental of the equipment is a good idea, especially since if you're 10+ you probably won't die. Yet that's something that seems awry in the gameplay. Maybe I was expecting another great LoZ game like Twilight Princess, even Skyward Sword was awesome.

Beyond is a game with mixed concepts although intriguing it can be hindered by game mechanics. Detroit human is where this five star rating is a must. This game is beautiful, crisp, and you never know when the decision you'll make will change lives. Peace or war, obey or freedom, sacrifice or living to fight another day. It's an amazing game where each character draws you in in different ways making you question truly what the best decision for yourself and or for everyone else is. The concept of an aware AI has been in our eye sight for years, but this game touches on the heart of it and demands the player to choose where they stand. The draw backs would be the occasional forced story line where the choice you would make isn't an option, lack of tutorial leaves the occasional negative consequences when an action was missed and lastly the game mechanics and view screen can on occasion leave you struggling to get your bearings. BUT in all honesty these things are so minor. The ending left me wishing they'd given us more but I see room for a second game and only hope the story just might continue. Overall this game left me emotionally ragged in all the ups and downs my people went through, along with making me really feel and know every action could save or kill my character. I give it a solid nine out of ten and a must play recommendation for anyone looking for a game where your decisions matter.",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,0,0,3 years ago,,5.0,4.6156,359,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10170789%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=80,122906309,1b7f2295-be8c-5c52-ba9b-44014bd760b0,2022-01-16T16:18:38

My partner worries about me going for long runs when I sometimes don't take my phone (stupid shorts with no pockets), so the safety features that the Venu Sq offer are phenomenal.

Pros:
1. Good enough battery life: If you just use the GPS to track your activity, it will last you for about 4 days on a single full charge, assuming you do a normal amount of activity per day (~1-2 hrs/day).
2. UI: I personally like the UI very much, you can go around and change stuff, and also have the Garmin Connect and Connect IQ app support.

Cons:
1. GPS: It can take about 5 seconds before the watch will lock your GPS location, and that can be a little irritating sometimes. Also, sometimes the watch will get the wrong location at the start and/or the end of your activity, and hence the top speed achieved for that activity would come out to be something insane like 40 km/h or something.
2. Battery life WITH music: I cannot really complain about this, since the company only claims 6 hours with GPS and music on. But I would have loved to have a longer battery life with music.

Overall, if you want to begin your fitness journey with a good smartwatch, this is the option for you.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,0,0,5 months ago,,4.0,3.7303,89,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11171973%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=20,233428341,2dd86887-3e7f-5ae5-8c57-237a291289f4,2022-01-16T16:18:42

For sleep it had to be light and comfortable to wear to bed.  The Venu Sq is one of the lightest smartwatches I've worn and the silicon band is very comfortable so it's easy to sleep with.

I also like the options of a vehicle having the capability of holding a lot of people. What I do not like is the game is full of glitches. This is not a well-polished game at all. It leaves a lot to be desired. If you have a FPS that you already like and know this may not be a good choice for you. The vehicles being able to carry multiple passengers are the only good feature about them. The viewing angles are awful and while this might be historically correct is does not make for good game play. Shotguns are ridiculously over powered! People one shot from halfway across the map as well as handgun sniping seems to be happening too. I don’t know if this a cheating issue or a skill issue. The last point I would make is that all the servers have very low Tic counts. This can make for some very short games. More load time then actual play time.

The only bad part that is standing because it was just released... The multiplayer is not balanced, I feel as though the game gives you the WORST weapons to start off with; It's understandable to give beginners OK weapons but the ones you receive are absolute garbage.

Even my kids were not very interested in it after very long! The whole game and everything about it is flawed. My whole family is hugely into Michael Jackson and if he was still alive to see this horrible game he'd sue the heck out of UbiSoft for trying to attach his name to it just for it not meeting his expectations alone! It does have alot of songs which is nice and yes they are his but whats so annoyingly awful about the about the whole thing is that the character is more like a cartoony silhouette that was mapped over someone whom only knew half of Michael Jackson's Moves. The MJ Training Videos are only like 10 seconds long and tell you absolutely nothing that you didn't know before! The dancing part is focused more on your hands which is understandable because of the Wii Remote but that is still no excuse for the Lousy Dancing used in the game because everybody knows that Michael was always about fancy-footwork! Alot of the dancing doesn't even match the original dancing done by Michael and appears like somebody just winged it pretending to be him simply because they got paid to do so. The game is just a huge wasted effort! This is NOT a game I would recommend to anyone and neither would Michael Jackson himself. Anyone that truely adores him should steer clear of this horrible waste of time game that attempts to take on Michael's Name because it simply isn't even worthy enough of it and don't even get me started on the Kinect Version, it's even worse!",No: I don’t recommend this product,,2,27,11 years ago,,2.0,4.3975,239,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10084317%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=70,16540573,5c8d90f9-ca1a-56a0-9968-7a8b249f9a7b,2022-01-16T16:18:49

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/wii/products/michael-jackson-the-experience---nintendo-wii/10084317.html,Michael Jackson The Experience - Nintendo Wii,Ubisoft,918038,RabidSyndrome,The most fun we've had in a long time.,"We brought this game home with our Wii -- it was one of the two games that made the family decide to even get that console! -- and popped it in pretty quickly. After dancing to one song, even my mother, who truly isn't a fan of video games in any shape or form except for the occasional arcade-style game, wanted to play. We managed to spend almost three hours just having sheer FUN with this, trying out the songs, dancing along, singing, whatever.

It has to be, as the review ""title"" says, the most fun any of us has had in who knows how long. Mom says that even when she used to dance at bars with my dad on the weekends, from the time it opened to the time it closed, it wasn't near as much as this, and I think I can compare it to my box-playing days, back when leaves were the big thing, you know? It's a great family game, lyrics and song content somewhat aside, and as long as you can have fun? You barely even realize that you're getting tired. Dancing like this is some of the best exercise available, I think, and if the Just Dance games are anything at all CLOSE to this, we'll be picking them up as soon as possible. It's probably the best investment we've made for the family in some time, and that's saying something. If we could give it a score higher than ten, we would.

On a more detailed note, the game reads the controllers surprisingly well -- you truly have to have fun dancing, you can't just move your arms; it reacts to your overall motion, which I've heard some dance games fail miserably at -- the graphics are very easy on the eyes, which could make or break a game; the concept is simple and addictive (there are no trick levels or anything like that, just dance routines that you may need practice to pass accurately); and even though the tracks are all from the same artist, there actually is very little concern about the replay value dropping (something I was seriously worried about!), as there are so many catchy tracks that it's not even a question. It's a hard game, but in a great way - you're not ready to smash the controller, ever - and really, it's so balanced that it's going to be hard to beat as games go on. if they ever make a sequel sort of thing, we'll be one of the first lined up to grab it.",yes: I recommend this product,,7,0,11 years ago,,5.0,4.3975,239,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10084317%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=80,16361619,b18e9c81-7851-59b7-8ad9-f25ca9d209f3,2022-01-16T16:18:49

There was a guarantee on the game so I wasn't necessarily worried about it working or not.  I waited about 4-5 days for delivery (no big deal there) and when I got it, the back of the actual game (where you can see the ""teeth"") looked to be almost rusted or degraded so badly that my 3DS couldn't even read the game.  So I had waited 4-5 days for nothing and had to drive half an hour to the nearest GameStop to do an exchange.  The staff were super friendly and patient about my issue but it still kind of stinks that I had the issue in the first place.  This little occurrence doesn't push me to order online again from GameStop.

EVER!,"Not only was this the first Pokemon game I was truly interested in as a kid, but I continue to love it to this day. I've played the game over eight times, each time training unique new Pokemon from the Unova region. On top of the new and fascinating Pokemon from Pokemon Black came a very compelling story that has defined the Pokemon world. The story challenges the ethics of capturing Pokemon led by the nefarious Team Plasma, serving under the Seven Sages and Lord Ghetsis. Ghetsis also seeks to gain more power and capture the Pokemon himself, so he trains a boy named N who eventually becomes the King of Team Plasma. N is an especially remarkable character in the Pokemon universe because his developments as a character left us all loving him even more. I absolutely love this game and it has defined my love for Pokemon from the beginning.

It plays well, albeit a bit too reliant on perfect motions, and really gets you into it.

The song selection is vast, and the entertainment value is high.

You get to pick whether you want to follow MJ's choreography, or the back up dancers, and it gives you a difficult for both.

The only real thing I didn't like about this game was it's lack of a tutorial. There is no way to learn how to play, other than simply playing. You catch on fast, but it would have been nice to have one.

The story in Pokemon black is a really fun and interesting, it's about a team trying to take away Pokemon from all trainers but i'm not going to talk too much about that, the story is not too long or too short. 1 of the problems I hate about this game is most Pokemon look weird I know it's not a new thing but they should improve. The gameplay is AWESOME they changed some of the battling moves so they look cooler now and sometimes when you are playing the camera turns in different angles so it doesn't feel like some blocky world. A other problem is when you finish the story you don't really have nothing to do except catching them all but there isn't that much Pokemon unlike the other games.

I would recommend this edition over the original because you will receive all the DLC that's available for the game. However being a DC Comics fan for a majority of my life, I have to wonder why they used Batgirl and General Zod. Quite honestly, Batgirl and Batman are basically the same except for genders and Superman and General Zod are basically they same so why use them instead of adding something new and fresh like Swamp Thing or even Killer Croc (even though I hate how many batman characters were put into this game). The skins are incredible and were used from multiple different storylines throughout the DC Universe such as Blackest and DC's new 52. The campaign was good (people who don't know the storyline would say incredible) and was entertaining. The campaign lasts around 5-6 hours but for a fighting game that's not too bad. Im hoping more future superhero fighting games are created like this.

The bundles are a great value. Just in checking at a few local stores the lanterns alone cost almost as much as the entire bundle. They are light-weight and easy to store as they are not big, but they give off BIG light. The little flashlights included really mark the way, of course we tested everything out. AND they come with batteries that you can trust to get the job done. I am not looking forward to having the power go out, but when it does we are ready, especially given how long of time it seems each time the power goes out for them to get it fixed. I gave sets to elderly parents too as they are easy for them to hold and use. One press of the button for bright light, 2 quick presses for dimmer light, and press and hold for the strobe light (just press again to stop it). The little flashing red light makes it easy to see in the dark. Changing the batteries is a bit of a challenge, but everyone practiced a couple of times so when we need to in the dark it won't be an issue. Just turn the bottom off then match of the arrowed notches to get it back together. Best investment I could make. I don't have to worry about dripping candles or fires with these.

In my opinion, each game gets better and better, and will only continue to do so. The originals will always be special to those of us who grew up with them, but it's very obvious that the graphics and overall lasting appeal of Pokemon Black far surpass them.

Pros: New places to explore and Pokemon to catch, while retaining the aspects of the original games that made them so famous. There's always something to do, even after playing through the basic storyline.

It is still a good pokemon game. But this has to be my least favorite version. I have been playing pokemon ever since red version first came out, and have played every version since. I had been waiting a long time for new pokemon to appear, and when i saw the announcement, i was excited! I got the game a little bit after it came out. There were some things i loved that they added, and some that i hated. Here is a list of my pros and cons:

Pros: Good story line
Beautiful cut scenes
cool environments
pokemon move in battle
mechanics were greatly improved

Cons:
Pokemon are VERY pixelated. (I know pokemon hasn't ever been about graphics, but its hard to tell what your pokemon even looks like in battle. This was the first thing i noticed whenever i started playing)

Pokemon are very uncreative. (Some pokemon do look pretty cool, but i noticed that a lot of them were based off of previous pokemon. Such as the one that looks like tauros in the first generation, and the one that looks like luvdisc from the third generation.)

Story is shorter compared to the others

Few things to accomplish after you beat the story.

For the first time since i have been playing Pokemon, i do not want to buy the next version in the series (Black and White 2) (i see the same problems) However, i will return when X and Y come out. Those look pretty awesome! My favorite versions are still emerald version, and heart gold version.

I played almost every game made, I watched the Anime until it got up to Diamond and Pearl (trust me the anime is horrible here recently!), and I even have a plush Pikachu! ^_^ All nerdyness aside *ahem* Pokemon Black is a great way to either start out in the series as a newcomer, or renew your faith in the ever popular franchise. I like the game all the way through from the animation, to the battles, to the little details they added within the game. I don't like the fact that rotation battles were not as frequent as it could have been, but they were fun nontheless. Hopefully in Black 2 they will have it more often.

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nds/products/pokemon-black---nintendo-ds/10078063.html,Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,920599,bluefin,Great Gameplay Improvements,"As far as basic gameplay and story go, this is the same as any other Pokémon game. Your character receives a pokémon, goes on an adventure to catch other pokémon, and on the way makes friends, battles other trainers, and defeats enemies. The character designs are interesting as always, the locations are nice to look at and fun to explore, and the new pokémon are well-designed for the most part.

Perhaps it was the way I built my team, but I noticed that the gym battles were much more challenging than they had been in the last generation. This was a nice change, because strategy played much more of a part in these battles than luck or elemental advantages. The post-storyline quests and regions are also larger, and even after many hours of gameplay I haven't yet done everything available to me.

This game really makes good use of the DS' connective capabilities. The Global Link is an inventive and refreshing addition to gameplay. The other online features are easier to use than ever, making the game more social than previous installments were.

One other vast improvement to the game is the soundtrack. Having played all generations except HeartGold/SoulSilver, I can honestly say that this game was the first one I can remember listening to all the way through. The annoying beeping when a pokémon reaches low health has been integrated into its own song. It is no longer repetitive and headache-inducing, but pleasant.

The lantern itself was smaller than I anticipated, but it is definitely bright. The fact that the globe easily comes off and allows it to be hung upside down is a plus. Getting the two extra flashlights (which are pretty decent) and all the batteries was just an added bonus. Why not 5 stars? Two reasons - the red LED that is supposed to blink all the time to allow you to find the lantern in the dark does not work on the one I received. Not a big deal for me, but that might be pretty important to someone else. Second, I have not used it enough to test the claimed battery life.

The lantern is very bright and way better than any lantern I've ever used. Of course, a Coleman gas lantern is brighter, but who wants to deal with all the negatives that go along with it? The beauty of LED lighting is efficiency. LED's consume something like 7 times less energy than conventional lighting. When you're without electricity #especially for a long period of time#, this is the lantern you want. I even saw this lantern in a popular home improvement magazine where it was praised as being the best on the market. By the way, have you priced ""D"" batteries lately? They ain't cheap, so the ""D"" batteries in this bundle must be considered when you realize what a great deal this is.

I never had to try a ton of times to beat a gym leader, and I got through the Pokemon League on my 2nd try.

First of all, It's too easy: Each starter is suppose to correspond with the 3 difficulty levels(easy-medium-hard). Trainers in each city use just about the same few pathetic pokemon, and wild pokemon repeat too much as appose to the other games where the pokemon repeated but not to such an annoying point. The game also provides a ridiculous amount of healing sources/items, and it constantly reminds you what pokemon types the gyms use..that's unnecessary. Second, It's just completely boring. There are no mini-games to play like in D&P, the soundtrack is nothing new, and over half the pokemon themselves are just quickly made and ugly.(Im not the only one who thinks so) Overall, B&W seem to have been made for people who just discovered that pokemon exists. I only recommend this to noobies, people who just want to play with new pokemon, or people who want to be prepared for B&W 2 which hopefully are like D&P.

Ever since playing Pokemon Diamond and most of the GBA games which were good but the story often got either frustrating and or respetive for me. I'm pretty happy I bought Pokemon Black to me it's the best out of any Pokemon game I've played, but there are some equally frustrating things about this one. Cons: One of the biggest problems I'm having with this game and the reason why I only gave it a average rating was because the new Pokemon are a nightmare! Not only are they not creative such as Wubat (who had me laughing for hours because it was such a rip-off of Zubat) but they are really weak! I found myself having real difficulties with beating anything after my 4th gym badge. I mean seriously my starter Pokemon Tepig; who is said to be the best out of the two other starters is in 2nd evolution level 35 and is losing to wild animals of level 22!! whats up with that!? Which believe me is SOOO frustrating!!! and for some reason they decided to pix-elate the Pokemon so the pokemon look like they did in the Gameboy Advance games which isn't horrible but they just leave you thinking why? Pro's: The pro's of the game is that the game settings are amazing! and unlike the Pokemon are so creative and just so fun to explore! The game also has lots of opportunities to help your Pokemon advance levels which would of been great except the Pokemon are really weak so it doesn't help much. Also I love that they didn't make the gym leaders ridiculously hard like they always do in the previous Pokemon games. In conclusion the settings and places in this game is great, the Pokemon not so great. So if you can stand always running back in forth from forest to health center throughout the game then I would recommend it! BUT If you get frustrated with things like that like I do you might want to wait and buy Pokemon Black 2 (which i'm totally getting) because they are bringing back the the good Pokemon generations as well as the new ones in this game and hopefully with all the new settings and places like this one:)",yes: I recommend this product,,3,4,9 years ago,,3.0,4.4195,553,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10078063%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=100,24037914,0fdb1b90-8cb3-546c-848d-c814d17552ce,2022-01-16T16:18:53

You twist the bottom off....put the batteries in then line up the red and white arrows to twist the bottom back on. You must use some pushing down force when putting this lid back on.

But slow at the end","Overall, excellent game. Most people have been saying how the new pokemon are pathetic, but i disagree. At first, i thought that they looked pretty stupid and would be pretty bad for a team, but i quickly learned to love them as i discovered more i didnt know were in the game. I agree, nintendo COULD have come up with better, but overall they did a great job. I have some new favorites from this game. But for gameplay, also great. True its the same old point of every pokemon game, catch all the pokemon and fill out the pokedex and become champion, but with all the new things they added (new moves, abilities, and battle styles), it sure turned that into a pretty neat twist. And the way I play pokemon games, the game could last me forever. But if your younger or getting it for a younger kid, it would end pretty quickly after the game is complete. Now for the downsides. Personally, i hated how they didnt add ANY of the new pokemon from previous generations. If this is your first pokemon experience, its all good and wont effect you, but for those who have played it before will be disappointed. And after completing the game, there isnt much to do after except for battling. No more story or anything. But what i did like is how they changed the wifi connections with the game. With previous pokemon DS titles, i couldnt connect the game to wifi because of the way the wifi was locked to specific connections. But they updated it so now it can connect to my wifi and is able to connect with all connections. So now im able to use all the wifi features in the game, which are great! So my overall conclusion is great game. I love what they added and some of the things they took out. With 3D graphics, a lengthy game, neat new pokemon, story line, and awesome new features, i say nintendo could have done a lot better, but still made something good and worthy to get.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,9 years ago,,4.0,4.4195,553,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10078063%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=110,23647897,ba90c04c-d099-5ebf-a1db-82f42bf94b25,2022-01-16T16:18:54

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nds/products/pokemon-black---nintendo-ds/10078063.html,Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,920599,dtwiiguru6,Geared toward novice players,"Pokemon Black Version is the companion to Pokemon White Version, the fifth generation Pokemon games. This fifth generation game really delivers the standard Pokemon experience. As I said, this game is geared toward novice players who are new to the series. Some of the features that can show you this can also really enhance the gameplay for anyone. The text moves faster, the Pokemon attack faster, and some more things to really enhance the gameplay. It's the little things that make the game more fun. But perhaps the biggest thing to make the game easy to pick up and play for anyone is that Pokemon gain so much more experience per battle that it makes level-grinding obsolete, which is a good feeling. Switch training is also still very effective for training many Pokemon at once. If a Pokemon has a status ailment, it will show it on the pokemon's body, like if the Pokemon is asleep the sprite's eyes close to show that it's asleep. Parts of the game stray away from that isometric viewpoint that many Pokemon veterans are used to, and make use of full 3D. The best examples of this are on the Skyarrow Bridge and in Castelia City. That alone makes the game so much more enjoyable. The music is overall not that great, but there are some songs in the game that are so good, they make up for all the bad ones. The following isn't anything new to me, but I think the female sprite is just hot. What can I say? Pokemon girls are hot. Pokemon Black is a great game. Good graphics, decent music, and the small things have been improved that just make the game more enjoyable. It may be a bit too easy for a Pokemon veteran, but this game is still very easy to recommend to anyone, whether you are a Pokemon veteran or new to the series.

It was a little over priced because i dont see charging over $150 for a hand held system as even reasonable but i digress. The game play is fun and the use of the c-gear makes it where you have to go online to do alot of things but its still a good game. The online how ever is not appealing in the least. While the use of wifi trading from around the world is kool you often come across 5yr olds with all rare and shiny pokemon who taunt you in the trade center or you incounter those who only want rare pokemon and will give you a very common pokemon in return (ex. they want to give you a magikarp for your reshiram).

https://www.gamestop.com/toys-games/dolls-dollhouses/products/kidkraft-grand-anniversary-dollhouse/11169802.html,KidKraft Grand Anniversary Dollhouse,KidKraft,318606,Swanlady,Modified the Dollhouse and it is absolutely lovely,"After months of searching, I decided that this 1:6 scale house for Barbie was the best deal.  Originally, I wanted the  Real Good Toys Estate house or  Real Good Toys Victorian Townhouse which are beautiful, but 3 x more expensive.   This grand anniversary dollhouse had everything that I needed, but the color scheme was not working for me, so I took the time to spray paint the house a pale blue and kept the white trim. I painted the red doors white to offset the light blue.  I also hung wreaths on the windows and doorway and put a topiary tree near the door.  The result was gorgeous.  I modified the floor plan in the interior of the home to add more room to the dollhouse.  It turned out wonderfully.

PRO(S)  Beautiful workmanship. Very good quality and sturdy.   Even though I wallpapered and repainted the inside of the house, I did admire the original artwork.  I had ordered some custom furniture on Etsy that didn't match the original artwork inside.  Love the working lights on the outside (2 ) coach lamps, as well as the working windows.  The wood is sturdy and beautiful.  Love that the house is similar to English dollhouses in the sense that it opens in the front.  The musical piano is especially nice.  This is a good pinterest project that  you can customize for your child or yourself.  I have received many compliments on the way I painted and changed the color scheme of the house.  

CON(S) The biggest con is the color scheme.  The colors are too loud and garish for my taste though I understand that many real life victorian homes are painted  in similar colors.  However, for a dollhouse the colors are overwhelming. The house is time consuming to build, but when finished it is worth it.  Also I was under the impression that the back of the dollhouse was painted due to an advertisement I saw f.  I was disappointed that the dollhouse wasn't decorated in the back of the house like it was portrayed in a neiman marcus Christmas ad .  Also the doll house only has a little bit of siding.

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nds/products/pokemon-black---nintendo-ds/10078063.html,Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,920599,Porygon,A Very good Pokemon game.,"The Pokemon series has kept to its roots for more than ten years, remaining a rock/paper/scissor-type RPG. With this very basic format comes with additional features, graphical improvements, and unfortunately, some negative things as well.

Don't mistake me for saying this game is bad - it is indeed a superb game. I would like to cover each aspect of the game.

We start off with the gameplay. It seems rather simplistic; water beats fire, fire beats grass, and so forth. Each pokemon you own can learn up to four moves, and moves are divided into physical, special, and stat. Moves are also divided into 17 elemental types, much like the pokemon. With these moves, you are to lower the opponent pokemon's HP to 0. Certain moves, known as HMs, are needed to access areas you couldn't access prior. Fortunately, for those who don't like using HM slaves, they are not required to proceed in the storyline, save for one instance.

As for the story, you are a boy/girl of around 14-16 years of age, with two friends Cheren and Bianca. The three of you are about to receive your first pokemon from Professor Juniper(who also happens to be the first female professor in the mainstream Pokemon games). With your pokemon, you will be setting out not only on a journey to defeat the pokemon league and claim the title of champion, but to be acknowledged as full-fledged adults, which makes sense, considering your character's age. Along your journey, you will be encountering Team Plasma, an organization striving to separate pokemon from humans. You, of course, are against this ludicrous ideal, and things become more serious.

As for graphics, 2D sprites don't really go well with 3D environments. But it's a nice step towards making 3D handheld games more detailed.

There are a few additional features, like the Pokemon Musical, and the C-Gear, but I'll leave you to try those yourself. These add to the lasting appeal, but because the Unova region is so linear(removing a lot of backtracking unlike other pokemon games), it still feels a little neutered.

Overall, this is a great pokemon game, like all other mainstream pokemon games, and I'm sure you will enjoy this game.

If you're in doubt, though, try giving it a rental first.",yes: I recommend this product,,3,1,10 years ago,,5.0,4.4195,553,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10078063%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=130,20785627,29be0bb9-a6c5-5677-880a-cabf9dc512ac,2022-01-16T16:18:55

I was expecting more, really. I have been a follower of pokemon since blue version. Now i dont want to be one of those 'old' people that just thing ""All new pokemon suck!"" cause that isnt true. I must say though, that they did take out some fetures that I liked from soulsilver & heartgold. The pokemon walking next to you, the pokewalker, and other things that i cant think of off the top of my head. Now the story line was okay, it was a little different than the original pokemon games, but still the same all in all. There are the bad guys that you gotta stop and then there is the eliete four that you have to beat in order to become the BEST.

The working porch lights and piano are a cool addition to a traditional toy. I also love the velvet upholstery on the furniture! Also love that you can close the house and hide the mess when not in use. The bilt app for assembly is a must - it made assembly much easier than traditional paper instructions. It accurately estimated the assembly time at 2.5 hours. Cons: We had a piece that was produced incorrectly that caused a major delay in setting it up. Piece 40 - the upper balcony - was backwards. It is a rectangle with 3 notched corners that attach to 3 columns (pcs 38 and 39). To make the piece fit I had to turn it upside down so that the ceiling fan was the floor of the upper balcony (it's a rectangle so you can't just turn it, it only fits one way) - the stickers that are the floor and ceiling were on the wrong side of the board. We worked around this by taking 38 apart and reversing the balcony railings (this piece is already nailed/glued together for you), but this prevented us from attaching the blue spandrels as the holes where they would be attached were on the wrong side then. So those are missing on the finished product but the kids will never notice. The house is already so colorful and busy that it's not a big deal that they don't fit.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,3 years ago,,4.0,4.7143,21,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11169802%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=20,209046885,c6387aed-2844-5866-9202-70af89c74e5e,2022-01-16T16:18:55

The wrestlers movement is slow and it sometimes it seems sluggish. The grappling system seems slow, the reversal system is bad (the idea of exact timing and requiring stamina make reversing moves difficult when compared to previous wwe games), and the only time a message pops up for your tutorial is after you've already done something which means you have to discover the game controls for yourself. That makes performing more advanced moves and features difficult. I found that career mode / My Player mode is also lacking. The storyline seems boring and the only choices that you make in the game are insignificant. In older wrestling games for season mode you could decide whether to be a singles competitor or a tag team competitor or who you wanted to form an alliance with but for this game you just create a generic character and get put through a predictable storyline. (I guess I'm a fan of a more open-world style career mode which this game is not) The only redeemable part of this game is its roster.

I also bought new COD & Assassins Creed and I have only played this game since opening it, leaving the other games to sit. It's like playing a crime-set soap opera. The story (VERY deep), the character development, are great. Humor is the classic cheesy humor in Yakuza games but it's delightful. Fights can get repetitive but they thought about that by giving us jobs to chose from to mix things up to keep you engaged. You are given the controls to become a full blown capitalist (one of my favorite parts of the game as it reflects my profession) Has lots of Easter eggs to the Pokémon world too but I'll let you find them in game... HIGHLY recommend playing through in it's natural Japanese voice setting, it's okay to read kids, and much less corny ALTHOUGH this is a HUGE improvement for Sega & English speaking characters (Shenmue 2 for reference, woof) the English speaking setting is much better and translates over a bit more but you can't be more authentic then speaking Japanese so do it.

From the beginning with Pokemon versions Blue and Red, all the way to this. Pokemon may have been a laughing stock to some people who are too ""cool"" to play it, or even look at it, but, when this was released, a lot of people were talking about it. ... And now, onto the review, overall, this game was REALLY great, it had really good sound, music, gameplay, etc. However, there's a little thing that might be ugly at first, but then you wont recognize it. And that thing is the zoomed in sprites of your pokemon in the battle, it looks pretty pixelated and unappealing, but, you'll hardly notice it.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,10 years ago,,5.0,4.4195,553,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10078063%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=160,18946281,469f204d-3e2b-5f99-8ae4-e03d676f02e3,2022-01-16T16:18:57

Also there is a coop and vs mode.. where you can play as zombies... Also in adventure mode two people can battle together.. Plus you get two games peggle and zuma.. what's not to love?

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nds/products/pokemon-black---nintendo-ds/10078063.html,Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,920599,TheRam,It's as revolutionary as Gen II[That's good],"Alright, I did enjoy Black. When I first heard about it, I was going ""YES! YES!"" Then, after a little while, I was thinking it'd be roughly the same as any other Pokemon game, save for the Unova Region's quirks.

At long last, I got the game on the 14th, and I've enjoyed it since. I must say, the Global Link is a great idea, something that I'm glad they implemented this Generation. Use of WPA Wi-Fi[for us DSi-Users] means less dropped battles and trades, the GTS resemble the one introduced in HG/SS, and I love the Random Match-Up![yet another feature I've long-awaited!] The graphics look great, as are the movements, similar to the ones introduced in Stadium, and every other Home-Console spin-off. The Battle Subway is quite unique, in my opinion, and I love how much attention they devoted to the trains alone![I'm a fan of trains]

Alright, there are a few cons though, but nothing major.

-Not every Pokemon can be seen or captured until Nintendo releases an Event. Japan has had a bunch so far, mainly Dream World, but everywhere else lacks Events to introduce the remaining few Pokemon unavailable.[can you say Keldeo?]

-Pixelation. The idle-movements of Pokemon are awesome, but, it doesn't look to great on some, if they're on your team. For example, Rapidash looks awesome, as the pixels are moving fast with the fire-effect. However, Zapdos looks somewhat distorted from the back.

-Connection. I love how the C-Gear teases me whenever it finds a signal, but I'm still required to go to DSi Settings, and configure it to work. Not funny, C-Gear.

-Story Length. Nintendo seems to want to emphasize connectivity even more. The Single Player Adventure isn't as long as it was in Crystal, for instance. Granted, there's so much to do afterwards, but still, I'd have liked a little more conflict with Team Plasma.

-Lack of a Move Tutor. Why Nintendo, why? This could have made Sweet Hearts more useful, rather than just restoring 20hp! Think of the Shards system in D/P/Plt.

-Names. Alright, this i a low blow, but... Ducklett? REALLY? Nintendo, you failed on some of the names. Thank goodness we can still Nickname them. -.-

As for Pros...[in addition to everything stated earlier]

-Pokedex. The Pokedex now is more 'accurate', let's say. For example, if you catch or see a Shiny Patrat[why you would WANT a Patrat to begin with is beyond me], it will record it as shiny.

-Graphics. This ought to shut up those who say the Pokemon series has terrible graphics. The Pokemon Series has never been about graphics, but Nintendo updated them because that's all gamers think about these days.

-Music. Another definite win for Ninty, the music is greatly improved, as usual. There are so many memorable themes, with the hidden options in some areas to add sound.

-Connectivity. We're using Infrared again, which is great, because it means I don't have to fly or walk to a town, just to save and wait for it to connect. Swapping Friend Codes is much easier too.

-Version differences. This makes it more necessary to trade with White[since this is a Black review] than with the Counter-Versions in past Generation, than for just a few Pokemon. White has more Pokemon, while Black has more items. So, you'll be hoping to find someone to get you a few little Pokemon from White Forest in exchange for some Fire Stones from Black City.

-Seasons. Another update from Gen II, we now have Seasons. This affects the terrain, the Pokemon that appear, and makes an otherwise uninteresting Pokemon unique.

The 3DS was about a month away, and no one could wait. But Nintendo pulled out a new Pokemon main series game to end the DS off, and we had no problem waiting another month for the 3DS. This game, in my opinion, is what Pokemon Diamand and Pearl should have been. It actually boosted up the graphics, made the Pokemon always moving, added a new camera view (both in battle and out), and made online play accessable. Plus the game has a lot of content... including 150 ALL NEW Pokemon. So... let's get on with the review. -----GRAPHICS------ Nothing ground-breaking, but they still look very nice, and the animations are great! -----FEATURES----- The game features 150 new Pokemon. That might be enough to make you want to buy this game. Plus there is a whole new region to explore with new cities, characters, and a whole new dramatic story. Plus all of the Pokemon from past versions are able to be caught or traded after the main game is over... so replay value is pretty high. -----GAMEPLAY----- The gameplay is awesome. It is Pokemon (and its fast paced, unlike diamand and pearl were). You run around and explore areas, finding your way through puzzles and areas, and pitting your Pokemon together in classic RPG battles. Pokemon in its prime. -----CONCLUSION----- This game is awesome. If you do not own either black or white, buy one of them (or both!!!). These games are true Pokemon classics... enough said!",yes: I recommend this product,,8,1,10 years ago,,5.0,4.4195,553,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10078063%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=170,18762069,6a245aea-2dc8-5485-8180-cd35fe8d1539,2022-01-16T16:18:58

Also notable: I tried mounting it with a VESA monitor stand (the included stand didn't fit on my desk), but it did not work. I had to bend the monitor arm's mount in order to get the screws to go in.

Zombies is a very intriguing game; I bet none of us would think that we'd be playing a Tower Defense for weeks on end.

The concept is very simple and it actually works better than you'd think. It's always fun to see what lawn setup works best and how you can create new and wild plant formations to clear away the zombies. Also, the grid-style map really does work well as a mouse substitute for the Xbox 360.

There are issues with this game too. You may hear everyone rave about how addicting the game is, but it really is easy to let go and forget to come back to. The gameplay really isn't something that will leave you wanting more and more. Some levels are very difficult and will force a lot of gamers off. After 20 attempts, you just lose interest and it's hard coming back to it.

This is one of those games that you can play when you are tired of shooting it out in your favorite shooter or exhausted of playing your sports games. This game will actually help your brain relax and take a much needed break with something different. You can play this game in between your hardcore sesions. For the price, it is an excellent value. The graphics are crisp and simple. The sounds will also make you crack up laughin sometimes. It does have repetitive soundtracks, but they are not annoying. There is just this element of good 'ol fun about this game. Within the game there's not only the story mode, but Puzzle and Minigames also. There's no online capability, but it does allow for you to play with a friend on the same screen (co-op, vs., and story). The main story is not long, but then you can replay it with new challenges over and over. So in a way it is unlimited. It also has a ""Garden"" section where you can actually grow plants and sell them for money. Money that you can use to increase your arsenal of plants and unlock other features in the game. Very entertaining for all ages. And don't get me wrong, I am as hardcore gamer as it comes, but this is just a good fun and funny game. I gotta give credit when deserved.

I have been a long time user of this brand and wonderd about the ""max"" bit.  Will it truly make a difference?

Well, I got the D size batteries and threw them into my Mag light flashlight.  Heavy duty flashlight that I keep around for all sorts of uses. 

I was surprised at how much brighter it seemed to light up the room.  Before, yes, it would light up the area nicely, but seemed, a bit dim.  Kind of like the difference of a brand new showroom automobile with fresh, not hazy headlamps compared to a car with hazy headllamps.  Yes, they can both light up the area nicely, but one has a better clarity and brightness over the other.

I found these batteries did a very nice job and seemed to last a bit longer.  Always a bit hard to truly judge without having 2 exact same flashlights, 2 sets of batteries only with 1 being the normal versus the newer Max batteries, changing them both at the same time and light up the lights and just wait it out to see which lasted longer.  

Overall, I felt that they were lasting and working better for me and seemed to brighten the area a bit better.  As I get older, my eyes enjoy more light, and I felt thes batteries helped give me a bit more benefit than others in the past.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,7 months ago,,5.0,4.9175,424,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11162981%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=30,231375310,c1559e5a-95df-54c4-b354-3c4315d69462,2022-01-16T16:19:00

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nds/products/pokemon-black---nintendo-ds/10078063.html,Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,920599,Ironmaiden1207,New and Upgraded Game Mechanics,"Pokémon Black is a great and refreshing addition to the series. Generation V adds in new pokémon (155 new ones to be exact, which is the greatest amount added to date) to excite and surprise both new and continuing fans. The updated graphics from Diamond/Pearl/Platinum are beyond what anyone who followed the game’s announcements at E3 expected (including me). Game Freak took the capabilities of Nintendo’s DS, a system that came out over five years ago, and pushed them to their absolute maximum. At first glance the graphics seem the same, but the battle animations as well as a few of the cities really pop out in stunning detail. Having said that, this review is mainly geared toward the continuing fans that understand the game’s underlying mechanics such as IVs, EVs, and the nature of breeding for competitive play.
After you beat the Elite Four, you can put two pokémon into the daycare (I’ve heard that you can only place one unless you do beat the E4). The breeding process is the same as in previous games. However, the Poké Gear doesn’t exist anymore making it much more difficult to know when an egg is ready. Also, it is worth mentioning that the path directly by the daycare is much shorter than in Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, making it more difficult to travel the thousands of steps needed.
The Unova region brings a variation to the traditional Battle Tower/Frontier with the new Battle Subway. Although differently titled, it still brings the Battle Points system back with the same kinds of competitive items such as the focus sash, choice band/scarf/specs, life orb, the power items, as well as a select few TMs. On a quick side note, TMs in the Black/White games do NOT go away after use. Once you have it, it stays for good, which is always a good thing for creating more than one pokémon with amore than adequate move set.
Training pokémon in EVs in the Black/White games is very easy. Using the power items on a pokémon while training them works exceptionally well. Some of the early cities have pokémon in the wild grass that are low level and can be grinded easily
Pokémon Black and White really help improve upon its previous game’s mechanics and breeding systems. The new and improved Battle Subway paving the way for easy access to battle items as well as TMs lasting forever really add to its appeal in the MLG aspect of Pokémon. All in all, Pokémon Black and White are excellent additions to the series, and I highly recommend that anyone with a DS pick this game up immediately!",yes: I recommend this product,,4,4,10 years ago,,5.0,4.4195,553,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10078063%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=200,17922963,47edd1ad-23dd-562a-bddf-8e1cde9fdcb9,2022-01-16T16:19:01

Therefore, I'm going to point out the flaws. I love this game and am in no way trashing it, I'm just saying what I don't like about it since everything else has been taken. First off, they took away most if not all of the puzzles in the game. I can't remember one classic strength puzzle in the game, which would be impossible considering how big they made the bouldars. Second, there's no big end game dungeon. In fact, the only good dungeon in the game is only a plot device. Third, there's no big surf area like in Hoenn. Fourth, the gym leaders are way too easy. Only one gave me any trouble. And, lastly, there isn't enough use of the new battle system. Although, when double battles came out, there wasn't much use of them. I suppose we can expect a Pokemon Colosseum type game soon for multi-battles. Once again, I do like this game.

I purchased this monitor specifically because it is listed as Gsync Compatible, and it is verfied by Nvidia as Gsync Compatible.  Its great when its close to the refresh rate.  However, some games that when the Frame Rates go below 100, or even 120 - 144hz, there is terrible ghosting and blurriness when Gsync is on.  Why is this?  If its officially Gsync Compatible, then there should be no ghosting as according to Gsync Compatibiltiy, Gsync should work 1-240 Hz on this.    Perfect example:  In Overwatch, during the menu screen, Blizzard caps it at 60FPS.  There you can see terible purple ghosting on the characters or letters on the menu when they move, when they are on a darker background.  Otherwise during game when you reach high refresh rate to 240hz, its fine.

The monitor does have excellent colors and contrast, and it is indeed fast for a curved VA monitor.

 The only way to stop it, is to TURN OFF Gsync and ghosting goes away.  But why should I need to do this?  I bought an official Gsync Monitor to -- yes you guess it! --  use Gsync!  When will Samsung acknowledge this issue with this monitor?",No: I don’t recommend this product,,0,0,1 year ago,,2.0,4.1605,81,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11137445%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=60,197004651,ffbc7b9e-cbcf-53e4-bda9-1b14c65bb67e,2022-01-16T16:19:02

The graphics on the first (TFU) are good, not as good as the second but, they are still very good. The Ultimate Sith Edition is a great Star Wars fan collectors item, steelcase, a card on a character, booklet, and most of all the DLC is included! This game has some time behind it, if you may have played the second on before this, you won't be disappointed to back track to play this title. As the graphics are good, controls are the same, story line is good, and you will put more time in this game in order to beat it than the second. If you want the full story of whats going on I Recommend playing this one before 2 or you maybe lost as to who is who and how you got where the second one picks up at. Some of the names in both games are in the movies. This game doesn't honestly connect any movies together, so don't expect that out of it. In all honesty the game is supposedly taking place between Star Wars 3 and 4, but it doesn't honestly bridge the two! Great game for kids and adults alike, and any Star Wars fan. You can use force powers, lightning, repulse, push, and many more to make your way through the stages and defeat the enemies. Custom customs are available to change your appearance, along with sabers, multiple colors to choose from, and different handles mean different boosts in points, health, damage, etc. I recommend this game to anyone who like action-adventures and/or Star wars in general.",yes: I recommend this product,,17,2,10 years ago,,4.0,3.9615,26,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10075652%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=0,20447876,3c415431-6171-558a-8a9c-65ad097a1a4a,2022-01-16T16:19:02

The more you play it the more fun you will have. I have played this game now for about 120 hours and I don't think that will be a fourth of the time I play it for. Yet at the same time I found that it was great if I only wanted to play for 20 mintues at a time. This is a great game for long time Pokemon fans and for newcomers to the series.

Adding onto the 3d cutscenes introduced in Heartgold/Soulsilver, Pokemon Black adds many new 3d settings such as more 3d cutscenes, 3d bridges and other setting in which you move around in 3d, and a beautiful boat ride around a city. The only bad thing about this game is the fact that there is an incredibly repetitive story line and not as much to do after the game unlike previous games (Hopefully Dream World will make up for that). The trading is a lot better with a not-so-tedious cutscene that only takes up a few seconds and infared trading is even faster! Fun little things to do over wi-fi/wireless add to the game play experience and affect your single-player world as well with black city which is suprisingly a nice addition to the game. Overall the game is quite fun but don't expect it to hold you for that long as the game is kind of short but every moment of it will take your breath away with its amazing graphics never before seen on the DS.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,10 years ago,,4.0,4.4195,553,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10078063%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=220,17699116,add07451-ac3d-597a-9c22-d7e84b1c6b15,2022-01-16T16:19:02

I know that people complain about the length of the of the original game released last year as a major problem. This edition has three new levels including the exclusive non-downloadable Hoth level. So the three extra levels on the second disc gives this game more length and playablility. Not to mention that you also get extra downloadable content such as the costumes that you could buy online and some exclusive to this edition. This edition also comes in a nice steel case with an exclusive artbook and foreward from the creators of the game, and exclusive card of one ot the main characters of the game. Also, you get two disc the first is the main game and the second is the extra three levels this is a great deal for the cost of this game. This game has incredible graphics my jaw drop a few times, because the sights in the game and the details are incredible. The sound effects is also awesome not to mention the classic Star Wars score and the new opening theme is great. The only minor problem I have is that sometimes it can be hard to lock on a certain objects to force grip and throw it in a particular direction. But other than that, the play controls are spot on. I also like how they make you build up your force powers in the game that way you can pick which ones that you want to beef up in your order. And speaking of force powers, I really like how they are over the top in terms of power. This is a great game a must buy, pick it up.",yes: I recommend this product,,29,3,12 years ago,,5.0,3.9615,26,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10075652%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=0,15251771,a09dfec6-8ad6-56f4-9762-019c7e4cd2e9,2022-01-16T16:19:02

The solve? Turn off G-Sync. The problem may be caused by using a AMD video card that is just old enough to not have drivers that are able to use the (now) open source encoding for G-Sync. 
While the colors are fantastic (purple is the best example of rich color on this display), the refresh rate makes great use of my high end video card, and the curve is set to the exact distance for optimal viewing, and the contrast is sharp as a knife, the ghosting was so bad while gaming and watching movies the monitor was nearly unusable for anything that has high contrast smooth motion.  Scrolling on web pages showed little to no signs of ghosting at all.

Very clear, and only a little ghosting but not too noticeable in game. On games that dip at about 100fps or lower, you can get weird imaging issues even with adaptive sync on. It is probably due to the screen tearing that would normally be there, but adaptive sync is trying to manage. So make sure you are changing the graphics settings on games optimal to performance on your PC to use the full 240 fps. That's where this monitor will shine, obviously! 

Va panel looks great, blacks are really good. The curve of the screen is not too crazy and is actually pretty nice.

I liked that in Diamond and Pearl, the climax was before the eighth gym, and the pokemon league. This way you could train your legendary pokemon during the pokemon league. This would help a lot in this game espescially since Reshiram works good against the Elite four. If they made another pokemon game in the future, It might be better if they put the climax before the eighth gym. This game also felt shorter than others. I don't have Heartgold or Soulsilver, so I don't know how long the story is, but if you look at platinum, it's a lot harder than black. Black also seems easier, especially since you don't have to complete the Unova Pokedex to get the national pokedex. You may not agree with me, but I don't think pokemon black is the best that it can be (although it's extremely close).",yes: I recommend this product,,7,1,10 years ago,,4.0,4.4195,553,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10078063%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=230,17586769,fddc7fda-8cc1-5252-ae2f-b36a755fed96,2022-01-16T16:19:03

Also, same as the other xbox, ps4 and pc platforms, the game play is too restricting in my opinion.  also, there is no snapmap mode so you can forget about creating maps.   and lastly, the multiplayer is, again just a mix of Halo and Cod, riddled with loadouts because it's too difficult for millennial to actually find weapons on the map and the demon runes are truly unnecessary and all it is just a crutch to help a losing team win.   back in the old school days, all you had on you was a pistol and 50 rounds for it, so you'd either find weapons, armor and whatnot or else you were a dead man.  other than all that, it's an okay game on the switch.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,0,7,2 years ago,,2.0,4.4127,487,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10153496%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=60,126981703,55ed5ec0-31ab-54f7-a314-06e951e202dd,2022-01-16T16:19:03

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-4/products/wwe-2k19---playstation-4/10164961.html,WWE 2K19 - PlayStation 4,2K Games,178722,P1Falchion,WWE 2K19 Review,"The WWE 2K games have been games I have stopped getting into after 2K15. The reason mainly was that I personally didn’t like the whole trying to be as realistic to what you see live on TV. I loved games like WWF No Mercy, Smackdown Here Comes the Pain, WWE Day of Reckoning, ect. The reason I loved those games was because it was pretty easy to get into and it wouldn’t take long for people to get use to the controls. So when I finally got my copy of WWE 2K19 I was excited because I can play as wrestlers from the current WWE/NXT roster, but I was also worried that the controls would be something would keep me from enjoying the game. Thankfully I grew to really enjoy this game, even though there are some things keeping it from being great.



In past WWE games there were story modes that either were original stories made by the developers or the story mode would be a simulation of past wrestling moments like the Attitude Era. This time around the game's story mode revolves around current WWE Superstar Daniel Bryan. The story mode shows a lot of moments of his career like one of his first matches in WWE, when he went by the name Bryan Danielson. To his big main event matches with John Cena at Summerslam for the WWE Championship and the Triple Threat Match between him, Randy Orton, and Batista at Wrestlemania 30. I really got into this story mode mainly because I am a fan of Daniel Bryan, plus it was really cool to see all of his big matches replicated in video game form and a lot of the scripted moments during those matches were great. It felt like I was really rewatching the matches it was simulating. I really don't have an issue with the story format 2K is taking with these games but, the story mode was pretty short. I think it would have been better if there were 2 more wrestlers getting to same treatment. Someone that comes to mind is the coverboy himself AJ Styles could have gotten the same treatment.



As for the gameplay which was my biggest concern walking into this game, is pretty much a more technical game, but it still is pretty easy to get into if you have played some of the WWE Smackdown vs Raw games. The only added feature is the payback abilities which is something you can trigger during a match, that can either give you a finisher stock or if there is a moment you know it will be hard to break a pin or submission you can use the resiliency ability and you automatically kick out of a pin/submission. There are a lot of abilities in this game and each superstar has something that fits their character. The way you can use payback abilities is by filling up a bar which can only be filled if you are fighting. And when the time is right payback abilities can help save you in a lot of situations.



Other added features to this game include match types like 5 Man Match types, more match types for 6 Man matches, and now 8 Man matches. Looking at 8 Man matches specifically, it ran pretty well, I didn’t feel like the game was running slow because of all the wrestlers on the screen at the same time. There were a lot of times when the game would glitch during matches like the Elimination Chamber, where sometimes characters would stretch as if they were Mr. Fantastic or one of Bailey’s wacky waving inflatable tube man and while it was funny to see sometimes it did happen a couple of times and I hope things like that get patched.



Overall WWE 2K19 was a game I really enjoyed playing and I’m glad I don't need to rely on past wrestling games as my only way to play wrestling games. I wanted to play a really good wrestling game with wrestlers that I watch on TV or with the help of WWE Creation in 2K19, people can make wrestlers from other companies like New Japan, TNA, ROH, ect and later upload the characters they made online and people can download them so they can be added to their games. And a lot of the created wrestlers people have made are fantastic and could have easily have passed as playable from the get go. WWE 2K19 is a really good time and while there are some improvements that can be made to it like adding more stories to go through, it was great to play a solid wrestling game.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,1,3 years ago,,4.0,4.2351,1195,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10164961%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=160,121115935,e97a123d-1b65-513e-9c02-67d5acabd934,2022-01-16T16:19:03

One of the things I do like is in the menu, they actually separated Male wrestlers from Female Wrestlers. The reason why I like this is because female wrestlers can not face guy Wrestlers, and sadly enough male wrestlers outnumber Female ones on the game 5 to 1 (if that...) So having to scroll through a super long list of Male wrestlers just to find the females to decide which ones I want to throw into the match was VERY annoying.  (Note: I do not know if this feature was in WWE 2k18 as I only played the Switch version for.. a small amount of time due to obvious reasons. But if it was, they I'm glad they kept it that way.  Otherwise I'm glad they added it.)",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,2,2,3 years ago,,4.0,4.2351,1195,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10164961%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=160,121033135,b11d73a5-706c-5c30-946e-3b513e429190,2022-01-16T16:19:03

I was really excited to play this game because I loved Until Dawn.  I finished the game in less than a day, and honestly, this game is complete trash compared to Until Dawn.  I was expecting a lengthy game with a good plot, but I got a short game with a horrible plot.  
The game had so many glitches and bugs.  My screen would freeze and I'd miss quick-time events.  The jumpscares were average.  There is no closure on the plot, you never find out what happened on the ship.  After all the action in the beginning of the game, you'd think they would give you an explanation as to what happened but there wasn't any closure whatsoever.  The game was completely rushed and after I finished I was honestly a little bit mad that I wasted money on this.  They couldn't have put less effort into a game.  I would not recommend this game.

Yep, and the story is pretty slow at the beginning. Team Plasma is closely related to the Pokemon version of PETA: only they still use Pokemon to battle with. One thing that is new is that your rivals are actually involved throughout the game and not just in certain parts. Overall, okay, but not great. Gameplay: Pretty much another Pokemon game, w/o new Pokeballs. You've got 150+ brand new Pokemon and that's it so a big throwback to the Kanto region. I did find some of the new attacks and abilities interesting, but that's a given with any new generation. The XP system is different, too: instead of fixed amounts, Pokemon level up depending on the level gap between other Pokemon. This makes it a bit more challenging and is one of its strongest points. Miss the touch interface emphasis from HG/SS, but it's still present. The C-Gear is cool and other goodies make it stand out from the previous versions. Graphics: Many Pokemon are not very appealing or original, and the few that are can be a lot of fun to use. There is a lot more 3D influence in this game and the various camera angles and field designs are really impressive. This is another one of the game's strongest points. I wish they didn't trade so much clarity of the Pokemon designs for movement; they looked really good in HG/SS. Sound: It's an okay score, not bad or great. Some tunes are catchy, but overall okay. Interesting how certain elements in the game cause changes to the soundtrack. Lasting Appeal: Was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the game, but not blown away. Definitely a must for Pokemon fans, but a little sketchy for little kids. Though the battle system is relatively the same, leveling up isn't. I doubt that they will get through the game easily with just a Lv. 70 Emboar.",yes: I recommend this product,,2,1,10 years ago,,4.0,4.4195,553,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10078063%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=250,17397619,640c638b-a270-53e9-8bae-c74ca4446f7d,2022-01-16T16:19:04

I played a fair amount of the original PC game and I'm sure this one would grow on me since the graphics are pretty amazing and the game play is intense. But it was a bit too gory to have around my kids so I returned it and got Zelda BOTW and SMK8. If you're into fast-paced, intense shooters then this won't disappoint!!! I have to admit, my eyes just aren't what they used to be and it was tough (for me) to play on the tiny Switch screen. I can't really rate how a major gamer would see this one, but for what it's worth it was one of the best games I've ever played for what my expectations were before I bought it. I think maybe someday I'd like to buy it again, but for now it was a bit much. I'm not a huge video game player and you would need to immerse yourself in it to get the full experience.

I praise the switch's gimmick, the ability to move your switch around and play in a somewhat VR-like experience with 360 fps.

However, the big point that sent me running for the hills was the myltiplayer, its current status is practically dead, no pun intended and not good in anyway. Whenever i would jump into online/multiplayer, i would spend about an hour or so just waiting, maybe getting lucky with a match.  The only way I could play online for sure is if I get invited or invite someone to my party, but unless you have many friends with the game don't expect too much out of the multiplayer aspect. Unfortunately, this was a big driving point & reason I had to return the game. I did not want to rate the game one star for this reason however, as I fear that would be unjust and unfair to the game as a whole.

It seemed like a very safe go around and thats what the game was. So if your a fan of this game type you will probably like it but dont go in hoping for too much.

I own both Black and White, and from my point of view, White is a better game because you can catch more Pokemon in White because of White Forest. If you're more of a trainer than a collector, I'd recommend Black, because it has Black City. Black City has a lot of trainers. this game's plot (as well as White's) are improved from previous games, as Team Plasma (The bad team) has a goal besides stealing Pokemon.

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/doom---nintendo-switch/10153496.html,DOOM - Nintendo Switch,Bethesda Softworks,158596,OrenFaust,True heir to the Doom name,"This is, without a doubt, the best shooter I have ever played, second only to the original Doom, where it all began (quite literally). Id and Bethesda came together to create, not a game, but an experience, that could hold a legitimate claim to the Doom throne, and what they came out with was overqualified. DOOM (or New Doom, as I like to call it) is everything anyone can, has, and ever will love about the First Person Shooter genre and so much more. It does what Doom always has, it innovates and improves upon the genre as a whole, taking the best of it all and leaving out the worst. New Doom is a remaster, reboot, and sequel all in one nifty, stress-inducing, tense, hair-raising, hellraising, action-packed journey through an unending wave of death. While Doom is not known for its story-telling (except for the film (eugh) and Doom 3), New Doom has a story, but it doesn't foist it upon you every few minutes and then gives you very little action, like most other shooters. It keeps the story to a minimum and cranks the nonstop action to an astounding 150%, and that's just after the first few chapters. It ups the ante as the game goes on, getting more and more intense. It's unrelenting, and that's Doom at its finest, as it always has been. Even the bosses don't relent, and even though they are few, they make it feel like you're going up against multiple bosses at once. The weapons are gorgeous. I got so turned on by the Gauss Can on and when I discovered the siege mode powerup, I absolutely lost it. It doesn't introduce many new weapons (in fact, the Gauss is actually the only new weapon), but it more than makes up for that by introducing weapon mods, which make it feel like you're using brand new weapons. Their abilities do use up considerable amount, but it makes up for that by dealing devestatingly massive damage to your enemies. And yes, the Chainsaw and the BFG are still there and, yes, they are as powerful as ever. The demons are so perfectly updated in their appearance. While they are a departure from the looks of the old demons, it's hard to mistake them for anything else other than what each individual demon is (for example, the Imp looks wildly different, but you still know it's an Imp just by the way it acts). There are only 2 new demons in the main story, but there is nothing wrong with that, because this is New Doom! You came from the 1993 masterpiece hoping to have a go at your old favorites as well as a few new contenders! And the game doesn't disappoint in the least bit. Besides, the game keeps you tense and on your toes so much, it doesn't matter. From the sounds of it, Eternal will have so many more new demons, which will more than make up for the lack of new demons here. New Doom is every bit of the shooter it makes itself out to be, and is more than deserving of being on the roster of the Doom series. If you're reading this, wondering if you should get in the game or not, I'd say you should absolutely get into it. Rip and tear... until it is done.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,1,3 years ago,,5.0,4.4127,487,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10153496%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=100,119548515,9a43beba-c71a-5a4a-934b-33d9ec36dd39,2022-01-16T16:19:06

What contains the issues is the multiplayer, not only are the servers so bad (it will sometimes take over 30 minutes to find a game) but the frame rate is so poor that it looks like you and the other person are lagging when it comes to fighting. I had high hopes for this (not as high as it was for the console of course) but it sadly and utterly let me down, the Switch did a good job of laying out the framework for Nintendo to have some AMAZING titles and collaborations in the future but this system was just not strong enough to do a game like this in multiplayer quite yet.

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nds/products/pokemon-black---nintendo-ds/10078063.html,Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,920599,UnovianChampion,An Absolute Masterpiece,"We first found out about Pokemon Black and White over a year ago. Then it came out in Japan in September, and now it's finally in Amercia. It was well worth the wait. Pokemon Black is the greatest game in the Pokemon franchise by a considerable margin. What seperates it from the other pokemon games is that it is just different. All the pokemon in the main story are brand new! There are two new types of battles. They are rotation battles and triple battles. They are a fresh new take on a classic battle system. This is one of those games that you just can't put down. I played 20 Hrs. the first four days I had this game! It's just that good! It is a VERY fresh take on a classic games series. It has absolutely AMAZING graphics! These are by far the best graphics ever seen in a pokemon game. These graphics push the DS graphic capabilites to its limits. This is a very beautiful game. Over and over again, I stopped playing to stare at the graphics. You can't understand how good the graphics are until you've played the game. The game has AWESOME music! I've played a lot of games and I can't think of a game with as good music as this game. The music is one of the many reasons that this is the best pokemon game yet. This is a long game as it will take you about 24 hrs. to beat it and then their is the aftergame. This is the longest pokemon aftergame yet. There's even a brand new champion to face! There are a lot of legendary pokemon to catch. This is will last a VERY long time! The aftergame is just massive. The game has the best story of any game I have played in a long time. There is A LOT of character development and moral questions. The game takes pokekmon to new levels. You ask yourself ""Is Team Plasma (the villians) really evil? There motives seem pure and good."" The game has outstanding pokemon and many new ways to play. This is my new favorite game of all time. I would reccomend it to ANYONE who considers themself a gamer. This game is a system buyer. I would buy a DS just for this game. This game is an absolute masterpiece and should not be missed by anyone.",yes: I recommend this product,,15,1,10 years ago,,5.0,4.4195,553,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10078063%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=270,17351610,f62e44ab-bdbd-5351-8701-aa9ec9875e91,2022-01-16T16:19:06

They upped the difficulty so that you can't simply breeze through the game with a single strong guy, which surprised me; but hey, who doesnt enjoy a bit of a challenge? The experiments with 3-D are very interesting and fun but unnecessary; this is certainly just the start of something big. I feel as though these little 3-D areas will become the center-piece of future games. And I LOVE that the characters frolick and close their eyes! Seriously genius innovations. My complaints are the constant involvement of rivals and the 5th generation of Pokemon. They really should've stopped a couple years ago, but we keep coming back... :P While certainly not the BEST of the Pokemon games (Hi-ho, SoulSilver!!!), Black and White provide an entertaining and unique experience that should be enjoyed by both new players and die-hard classics alike.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,10 years ago,,5.0,4.4195,553,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10078063%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=270,17348786,cd15edd7-6878-52ed-b68e-626cc130b704,2022-01-16T16:19:06

At first glance of the new Pokemon, I actually laughed, and said this was going to be the worst game, and they should really give up on Pokemon if this is what they've got. I WAS WRONG. While some of the Pokemon are still unsatisfying compared to past Pokemon, I have truly fallen in love with this game. The graphics are impeccable, and Castelia City is the most incredible work of art and amazing graphics I've ever seen on a Nintendo DS. The only complaint I have is that the menu should be on the touch screen like it was in Heart Gold and Soul Silver, instead of the C Gear..... but I love the C gear as well so it's hard to decide how I really feel about the set up. Although, like I said, I'm sill iffy on the Pokemon, but I understand how they came to be so, since the game is largely focused on industry, the Pokemon reflect that. Trubbish and Garbodor are the only two I still really don't like. But again, Best Pokemon game to date.

Since then, I've been playing for quite some time. The Pokemon are certainly different from other versions of Pokemon such as diamond, ruby, silver, etc. Generation X and V Pokemon show how far the Pokemon company has come since Generation I (yellow, red, blue). The graphics show how advanced the Pokemon Company has become. The 3D really shows and if the Pokemon Company is planning on making a version for the upcoming 3DS, I would certainly think that it would truly be a breath-taking game. As a player, I certainly love this game. I do believe that team Plasma's goal is quite different from those of the past and there are many mysteries awaiting to be uncovered. If you are a dedicated player who plans on sticking through Pokemon Black and/or White until the end, I strongly suggest purchasing this game. However, if you feel that you will play it for a few days then quit, I would not recommend getting it because Pokemon Black & White are the kind of games you just have to stay until the end to fully understand everything.

While the characters in this aren’t as likable in Until Dawn. This one is a lot harsher on QTE’s (Quick Time Events) than Until Dawn. That said it’s somewhat more intense than Until Dawn but not quite as intense as the VR Prequel to Until Dawn “The Inpatient” but it’s still just as unsettling as the both games.

It came off as a bit tedious with helping all these different groups you joined. Eventually I just stopped dealing with those side missions and stuck with the main story and had a much better experience. Who you’re in league with does effect the difficulty of the game toward the end, and at that point I was in the good graces of only one of the three groups. The wrong one at that. It all works out fine if you can use your power suit to overcome the extra level of difficulty.

My starter was Oshowatt and already has reached its final evolutionary stage. I got five badges already, and already caught Victini. If I had a piece of advice, battle everyone, strength is major in this epic new pokemon game. Also some trainers give you free items for you beating them. But type match-ups can be a struggle. So hear is something very useful. At the first gym, the leader will tell you you should have a pokemon that is good againt bad match-ups so he tells you to go train at a sertain place. Go there and find this one guy who gives you a free pokemon for an advantage at the gym.

I love everything about it and the story-line is truly fantastic to go through. The changes they made to graphics and environment are revolutionary for pokemon and it truly creates a new dynamic. The game is very fun and it is more challenging then the others and they created some pretty awesome new pokemon. The way they changed TM's and the new phone system alone are superb. The way you can connect to friends also makes the game very fun. If you are a pokemon fan then Black/White is a must have.

It still retains the basic pokemon formula, beat all 8 gyms and become the champion. However, I have two specific complaints about the game. First, the fifth-gen pokemon. They seemed rushed and unoriginal. *SPOILER WARNING* Second, once you beat the Elite Four, you would expect to fight the champion, right? Wrong. The evil team's leader, N, comes and makes you fight him, right after catching Reshiram. Then you fight the other ""leader"". I was looking forward to fighting Adeku. Not the two leaders. Other people may like this change, but I don't. The graphics are the best I have ever seen in any pokemon game, so far.

Leveling up. I'm trying to kill demons, not dragons. FOH with that Skyrim rpg garbage.
Mandatory internet connection. I bought this for my portable system. Why would I need to be connected to the internet to play campaign? You've literally made it unplayable for the majority of the customers. Oh, and if your connection drops, it boots you and loses progress.
Massive download. If you don't have an sd card and have some other games on the system you're gonna have to choose between them.

But honestly, they aren't even trying anymore. I suppose you would love this game if you're a die hard pokemon fan, and I suppose kids would as well as the series will still be new to them, but anyone who enjoyed the old games should know by now what to expect, a hundred hours of walking in grass to get the badges and beat your rival.

From what I’ve read, and seen first hand, Energizer batteries are by far the best batteries out there.  

First, they have a very long shelf life.  This is extremely important to me since I live in an area prone to storms and power outages.  I know I can always count on my little “stockpile” of Energizer batteries whenever I need them.

Second, these are alkaline batteries.  This is the most common type you’ll see in the stores but it’s worth point out.  There are also a lot of so called Extra Heavy Duty batteries which actually use zinc not alkaline.  This type of battery will last less than half as long and are prone to leaking.  

Third, Energizer batteries will outlast any other battery.  This isn’t an exaggeration and you can do a simple test to see for yourself.  One way would be to use identical flashlights with two Energizer D batteries in one and different brands in the other(s).  Flip them on at the same time and I can guarantee that the Energizers will be the last to run out.

If you’re looking for a dependable battery, care about your electronics and want something that will last then Energizers are the batteries for you.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,8 months ago,,5.0,4.9175,424,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11162981%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=150,230882118,696b5b57-6c4f-5d4c-9589-1b4c70ac2500,2022-01-16T16:19:08

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nds/products/pokemon-black---nintendo-ds/10078063.html,Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,920599,Pokeforever,BEST IN YEARS!,"I have played the JP version of Pokemon Black (and White ^^) and I have to say that these games are just the type of kick to the series to really bring Pokemon back to light.

In a move that hasn't happened since the time of R/B/Y, Pokemon Black/White introduces not only new pokemon but 155 NEW pokemon, NONE of them are a pre-evolution or an evolved form of previous pokemon, new, never-before used pokemon types are used, brand new abilities, and the Team of this generation has a unique motive!

Also, in the new region of Isshu (Unova in the English version apparently), none of the first 493 pokemon appears in regular gameplay before beating the game. This might sound bad at first but wait until you see how the developers make them available for capture (at least in the JP version anyway)!

The aesthetic changes are very refreshing. The 3D graphics in this game are amazing (for a DS game). The biggest examples of these graphics are...no....I already said too many spoilers. ;) However, my only qualm with this game is the fire starter. You'll see why when you evolve him. Also, there aren't very good HM hoarders this time around but these factors don't actually affect the game that much, if at all.

Unless a certain game is released next year, Pokemon B/W could very well be the best game of 2011 and of the first quarter of 2012. Anyone who considers him even a little bit of a gamer MUST play this game at least once.

I end my review with the battle system. With the addition of Rotation Battles and Triple Battles, more animated battle sprites, and with combo attacks in addition to everything else, playing Pokemon B/W made me feel like I was 4 again playing Pokemon Blue for the first time.",yes: I recommend this product,,13,1,11 years ago,,5.0,4.4195,553,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10078063%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=300,16361764,617fd622-0c4e-5219-b6fe-6ea742743d9c,2022-01-16T16:19:08

It was kinda short, but I guess that's to be expected,  so the developpers can bang out several in the series (hopefully quickly) , and the price reflects that (~30, compared with the usual 60).

Its fun. The open world doesn't take you so far away from the story that you forget where youre supposed to be going and the story is very immersive. Even on easy it provides a decent enough challenge that you cant just run and gun your way through the story. The drawbacks are that for a ps4 game, the facial expressions and general animations aren't the best, quite a few controls have to be found out by yourself, the tutorial doesn't even mention them.

But it was fun watching each other and suggesting reactions and replies to the pop-up queries. The ending kinda sucked but I saw it coming. I am wondering if changing my game play decisions and response to the ques would change the outcome that much. Guess I will try that and find out.

I didn't pick up doom last year so I was new jumping into this game.

Docked mode not so much but it never soured my experience. This is a great port. If you haven't played doom or if you just want it on the go you wont be disappointed. This game is a must have for nintendo switch owners and at first 60 bucks kinda didn't sit right with me, but seeing how much work went into getting a game this demanding to run on the switch it is very much worth the price of admission.

Surely enough, following it's release in Japan, I held a copy of it in my own hands just a few days later. Now, 412 hours into the game (At least, says my DS) I can safely assure you that this game is nothing short of fantastic. GameFreak has outdone themselves with this new duo, improving upon the classical formula that we all came to love over a decade ago. The new 3-D layout of the graphics is nice and very aesthetically pleasing at moments. While many would be surprised, the continued use of the 2-D sprites actually fits quite well in the new over-world. Battles are more fluid. In-Battle, Pokemon now have fluid animation continuously throughout the battle, comparable to the beginning animation you used to see for a brief second or two when sending out a Pokemon in the previous games. The camera moves around slightly, keeping your attention to the battle, wondering what view it may pan to next. The difficulty is not too hard, some may find that the final challenge in the story is rather easy, but that's not a big concern, for there is a long after-game segment. In fact, there are even multiple cities that are unavailable until the story has been completed! The number of Pokemon continues to increase, as this generation adds a whopping 156 new ones, the most ever to be added in a single Generation, surpassing even the originals! The audio is clear, the Pokemon cries are now extremely unique and interesting, and the music tracks are outstanding. While I can't be certain, there are likely more music tracks in this game than any previous one of the series! Having shown my friends this game on my DS, I've yet to find a single one that has not been intrigued, or interested in this game.

It was fun and I liked that I was able to play online w/a buddy of mine. Having said that, the ending came about too quickly and I accidentally ending up saving all but 1 character. Which, I was pleased with but it was all just too easy. It only took like 2.5hrs to complete.  Also, if you choose to play online with a friend be prepared for important scenes of dialogue to end abruptly. I won’t explain why/how I think that happens because it may give away the plot but I’m hoping that by the time “Little Hope” is released the developers have fixed that glitch.

Narrative: was expecting more, overall it’s ok for 4 hours. Just massive horror tropes, nothing special. Character depth: very weak. Storytelling: average. 

Gameplay: Playables move like tanks, qte are decent but repetitive and nothing new, would have never did a second play though from the beginning, incredibly slow and not entertaining. Chapter selection available after first. 

Graphics: for a major def far from what you would expect from a 2019 big budget game. Frame rate drops, bugs, bad acting. 

Really hope the second title will learn from this flop. Until Dawn seems far more advanced. If it doesn’t get better I doubt will get the third title.

I did not play Movie or coop. MN seems fun with friends, coop sounds interesting. 

Overall: I don’t regret my time spent on it and made all 5 survive with 1 playthrough + 2 chapter selects at the very end. Not worth full price, ok to buy used and have some nice jumps but very far from titles side as Detroit, Heavy Rain le Until Dawn (which still needs work but was fine for the year and moment it came out) - just to stay in the same ballpark.",No: I don’t recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,0,0,2 years ago,,2.0,4.1324,476,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10170150%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=90,134758924,180932fa-8f12-5b7a-bc98-aa4b2c613a84,2022-01-16T16:19:09

Im NOT a fan of the water pokemon in this game though so my choices will be Grass and Fire...Another thing the pokemon company needs to change is the type of fire starter pokemon we get.

At home I have a 3 monitor setup and this is the centerpiece, providing a perfect amount of real estate for almost anything I could need. Finding a desk mount that was able to support the weight was difficult as this thing is pretty hefty. The monitor is substantial, but there are a few pieces that felt like they will easily break over time like the back plate that covers the inputs. I have had this monitor for about a year now though and so far it has not broken although admittedly I have not taken it off and put it on a lot in that time. I haven't experienced the light bleed that some have experienced on this monitor so far as I can tell. FPS gaming on games like CoD Warzone is amazing on this thing and being able to comfortably have several windows up simultaneously is awesome as well. I am not a fan of the lighting zones tho.

When my controller became disconnected, and I'd re-attach the cord, my headset would almost always emit a horrifying screeching sound, or loud static.

Nostalgia 

COMFORTABLE 

Functionality 

Durability 

Xbox Logo LCD is AWESOME 

Cons: 

Not wireless 

Not for people with small hands 

Left and right bumpers might be a bit to far for some serious fps gamers. 

 

I was using a Razer Wolverine Ultimate (same shaped and design as Xbox One controller) before this one and let me say just how good this controller feels in my hands in comparison. The Razer was giving me a really bad palm blister. As a gamer knows we can play for several hours at a time and I feel I can play with this controller for hours with zero discomfort. The left and right stick are very springy, responsive and have a sense of resistance unlike most third party hardware producers that make thumb sticks feel weak. They have a grip textured feel to them that feel amazing. The way the dpad feels might not be for everyone but I love how squishy it feels. When you hit the home button it plays the original xbox boot screen and I cant people enough about how freaking awesome it is. I highly recommend this controller to anyone who is experiencing discomfort with their current controller or anyone who is looking for a good hit of nostalgia. I am very happy with this purchase.

I enjoy!,"I am a Fallout fan and when I comleted the last two entries, I was hungry for more. Fallout 4 provides a familiar feel to its predecessors, but it is all new locations tied to a compelling narrative. I play on a standard PS4 and the graphics are wonderful, the controls are smooth, and sound is engaging.
There are some minor issues with subtitles and the conversation camera angels seem arbitrary and strange (but both can be turned off in settings). I have not completed the game yet, but I can still say it is just what fans of the series would expect with a low cost to entry for first time Fallout players.

The guns in B1 look much better. In B2 they all look really weird that you would think they're all alien guns.
In B1 you like the bad guys(especially General Knoxx), in B2 you are annoyed by them as they tell unfunny jokes and crude humor.
There are also some mean things that they do to old characters in B2 that I really hate. I can not tell to you here, you must google it.
The atmosphere is drenched with depression every step of the way, that it sucks.
Also they limited you to 27 items backpack. Yes, a huge downgrade from B1.
Gearbox made some lame excuses about why it is that way, but you can tell the writer does not even believe what the he was writing.

If you have a pc that can run it then get it for pc you'll love all the added Physx stuff that goes along with it and having native 1080p support where as the console has 720p then upconverted and no AA applied. The game for all 3 systems is solid and very fun. More story this time around. Graphics are good but if your a PC gamer and play this game on console for example I originally purchased for Xbox and edges of the game are really jagged and some of the graphics are meh. On PC you can apply AA or FXAA and it'll get rid of the jagged edges and the graphics are bumped up. Also the game supports physx so you got some extra goodies with the game if your card support it.

My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is I think there should be a way to only use the middle portion of the screen (not ultrawide) for those things that are not ready to run in ultrawide mode.

It has definitely enhanced the experiences for both simulators. 

In racing, I can now see further into corners without having to change the viewpoint. As far as emersion goes, it's nice to be able to see the driver's side and rear view mirrors at the same time. Depending on the vehicle, sometimes you can see both side mirrors, which feels nice to me.

It's use for flight simulation is even more pronounced. Situation awareness doubles with half the movements. Immediately, taxiing and landing become easier because of the side references. It's also easier to track gauges during these operations because of less viewpoint changes. Of course, looking out of the window on VFR flights is stunning.

It is also a great monitor for having multiple pages open. I can have 4 pages of notes open simultaneously with no problem. I did have to adjust the font size for this type of operation, but once adjusted, everything is great.

Here's why the monitor looses a star. When you are looking around (changing the viewpoint) in flight simulation, the outer quarters to thirds of screen will begin to distort and elongate. It's usually not that bad, but I thought it is worth mentioning. Really 4-1/2 or 4-3/4 stars is more accurate for this monitor.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,0,0,1 month ago,,4.0,4.5319,643,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11137439%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=170,212600537,2258777b-42a6-50f0-8e61-13644a5f3c38,2022-01-16T16:19:16

The home is quite large as it is both floating and moving high above the sky, the home also provides multiple floors through hidden doors, an arena, and plenty of outdoor space. Stats wise the gear is ok but you’re far better off using in-game gear such as Waterworks and Darkmoor gear. Appearance wise however the gear is quite nice, well detailed and very unique, but I’d definitely say the wand is the nicest piece of the gear on appearance alone. As for the pet and mount, the pet is life school so that may be worthwhile for life mains but other than that it’s cute while also being a bit larger than I expected. The mount is also quite nice, it’s only 40% speed and on the smaller side of the mounts so it only holds one person, but very smooth animations and while it may not be as wide as other mounts it does have a bit of height to it. Overall it’s a very nice bundle and if you’re at all interested in Mooshu themed gear and home then this bundle is worth it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because stat wise this bundle isn’t the greatest but I feel most people won’t be buying it because of the stats, it’ll be for the home and appearance of gear.",No: I don’t recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,3,0,1 year ago,,4.0,4.7209,43,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a11102116%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=0,163026764,64a9db28-c60e-50b8-93d9-9e582b25cbb7,2022-01-16T16:19:17

It's a bit quirky at times, but once you learn how to resolve it (typically unplugging the second input from thr device)  I'd say the trade off of it being finicky at times makes the feature well worth it and I'm sure it'll get better with time.

I've had batteries that didn't fit securely because of a smaller than standard size, some that didn't last more than a few days in a low drain device, and some that leaked into the device after just a few months.
Well let me tell ya...these Energizer Max D guys are exactly what I prefer in my name brand flickering flameless candles. They fit snugly and don't bend the spring, and by far outlast competitors. On average I get about a month of 12hr daily use from one set, surprisingly these candles are actually a higher drain because of their constantly moving flame, so frequently buying unbranded batteries ended up more expensive than buying Energizer. Having a longer shelf life also means I can stock up when they're on sale and not worry about them being dead upon opening.

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-4/products/fallout-4---playstation-4/10122221.html,Fallout 4 - PlayStation 4,Bethesda Softworks,119073,RealCannoli,An In-Depth Review of Fallout 4,"I've played Fallout 4 a lot, I've spent 170 hours playing it on steam and another 50 or so hours on PS4. The game is a shooter/RPG combo, much like its predecessors Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. There are changes that have been made to this installment though, some of them help it really shine, but some of them feel like the game may be abandoning its core audience. As opposed to the previous games in the series, this game is very action oriented. You will find yourself using the new sprint function a lot, and in lots of high energy shootouts. I enjoyed the adrenaline rushes from these segments, but I can see why hardcore Fallout fans could see this as a negative. There have been many changes to the stats of the game, skill are completely gone, replaced by perks that you unlock as you level up. This system was implemented to avoid being perfect at everything I think, but it doesn't really work because a lot of perks that improve your skills don't have very high requirements in their respective ""S.P.E.C.I.A.L"" (What represents attributes that would be in other RPG's. A settlement system has also been implemented, although not very well in my opinion. Lots of your custom homes will probably end up looking like stacked squares, or maybe I just suck at the home building, either way I didn't get much out of it. The storyline is alright, having a branching story that involves 4 factions trying to obtain control over the commonwealth (The area in which Fallout 4 takes place), and to avoid spoilers, all I'll say is that there are really only 2 factions with fully developed stories, and really 2 distinct endings, although the monologue is the same with every ending, which is very disappointing. The dialogue system has been simplified, tossing a lot of flavor text, which wasn't really a bother or a credit to me, it was kinda just there. If you're looking for a fun RPG/Shooter that leans more on the shooter side to sink a lot of time into, Fallout 4 is the game for you. If you want to play Fallout 3/New Vegas in a new engine, you might just wanna skip this one. Oh, and as typical of Bethesda, lots of bugs and crashes.",yes: I recommend this product,,10,0,5 years ago,,4.0,4.4535,1182,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10122221%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=300,76146346,58a90407-423a-514e-9cb8-ee959ff34d0b,2022-01-16T16:19:23

Also, npcs have about 3 lines of dialogue and are very shallow. The dialogue wheel was pointless and every option had the same result. The settlement builder seemed like a good idea but wasn't thought out very well. It felt like it was just tacked on as a afterthought. Overall that's how a lot of the game felt, like it wasn't thought out and was half assed.

Although, you're going to have more of an emotional connection with your character, Shepard. He/She is the embodiment of yourself, whether you abide by what's right or what's wrong. Sure a lot of people create their character to be the hero or villain they can never strive to be but if you're like me then you'll be emotionally connected in defining Shepard, in such ways as picking options that coincide with what you feel or even what you'd do in a similar situation. Anyway the voice acting is on par characters like Liara and Garrus portray a believable entity while Jennifer Hale as Femshep is astounding. In terms of the graphics you'll shutter in fear at the detail and height of the towering Reaper flagships and depending on your modeling skills, admire the beauty/handsomeness of your Shepard including other vital characters. Gameplay is great as usual, with a wide assortment of weapons to combat the reaper and cerberus hordes as well as the various abilities that further defy your foes. Lastly as for the ending, many say that it was awful but with the extended cut it's at least acceptable by RPG standards, what matters though is the journey not the destination in Mass Effect.",yes: I recommend this product,,14,0,7 years ago,,4.0,3.6667,18,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10089160%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=0,34330944,f7b542ef-9331-5879-9765-0f606f08e1bf,2022-01-16T16:19:24

The RPG elements are very minimal and the high-octane action is pretty much driving the whole story. If you enjoy action-adventure games that simply tour different exotic set-pieces, then this game is well worth $30-$40. If you like quasi-strategic action shooters, you might have a great time with this. But as an RPG, and as the critical installment in a series, the game falls quite flat.

There were also quite a few graphical and sound glitches at launch, as well as gameplay hiccups that hurt the multiplayer experience. Beyond that, the ""action button"" technique that Bioware insists on using is quite cumbersome in this game. The action button has about 5 or 6 different functions, which leads to a lot of gameplay problems.

I wanted to shed a tear it was so amazing, and it came to a conclusion that has a cinematic ending that anyone would hope for if they were watching a film, its just that because it is a well loved game nobody likes it.

Coding is much easier since there is so much screen real-estate, gaming is immersive, and watching videos is immensely enjoyable. The curvature of the display makes it easy for my head to move around or the lack-of head movement since the view of the windows is easy to see.

The game was a little bit slow at the beginning, but once you leave the vault and complete a couple story missions, you become addicted fast. I played for hours one day, just customizing my settlement, adding defenses and salvaging supplies. The customization is insane, as it should be in a Fallout game. I've created several weapon mods, pieces of armor, and looted anything I can find. The experience point system is pretty good too, and the story can get a little boring at times, especially when you get bombarded by Preston Garvey to help another settlement. The graphics are mediocre, but that's not the reason people play Fallout. If you are discouraged at the beginning, keep playing a little while longer and you might find yourself loving this game.

With updated graphics, a new place, different characters, and new systems (V.A.T.S. slows down time instead of stopping and new perks system) it is just as good if not better than fallout 3.

If you're picky about your controls and being able to customize them, don't get this game! Another complaint I have about customization, which is two-fold: why are the options under EXTRAS of all places?! And graphics settings don't even exist! If my computer is running anything in the background, I cannot play this game because I can't turn down the graphics settings from gorgeous to performance. Oh wait, I can turn dynamic shadows and anti-aliasing on and off, because that makes all the difference. No, wait, it doesn't. Finally, my third problem with this game: If you're a hardcore Mass Effect fan as I was, DO NOT buy this game! If you don't get the From Ashes DLC, it will not feel like a finished game! Then again, even with that, don't get it for the story, as the ending (trying to avoid spoilers) is the worst ending to a game I have seen in an EA title, much less a Bioware title. I've played Call of Duty games with better endings, and I don't even like those games! Ranting aside, the gameplay itself is epic, and it is DEFINITELY a fun game, especially the multiplayer. If you're in it for the gameplay, this game is definitely worth buying (other than the spacebar). It has the feel of an EA game rather than a Bioware game, however, so I'm conflicted on whether or not to recommend this game.",yes: I recommend this product,,4,4,9 years ago,,4.0,3.6667,18,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10089160%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=10,23190619,e1640bfd-8e3a-560a-83d4-b33d387312ed,2022-01-16T16:19:25

There have been a lot of complaints about small details at the ending but i won't say any in the event i spoil it for someone.

If you played any of the previous games, this game will be twice as good. But it is not unapproachable if you haven't. Some people complain about the ending, but there are 3 reasons this shouldn't discourage you from buying: 1) Developers have already agreed to write a new ending and are probably going to patch the game with it in the future, 2) The whole game is great enough (especially the whole series) to make the 'bad ending"" only a minor deterrence in a great game, and 3) story doesn't affect it's multiplayer, which is enjoyable as well.

The multiplayer co-op is fun and challenging. The story itself throughout is fun and enjoyable, plus they do an amazing job of tying the events of the previous two games together and making you feel like your choices matter.

In the end, though, they don't. The ending is so sloppily and lazily done it destroyed the whole franchise. Choices no longer matter as Deus Ex Machina tears apart the 'choose your own adventure' style of storyline for a force railroad that leaves the joy of playing these games bloody and broken on the tracks.

I can't even bring myself to try to play and enjoy the MP aspects of it anymore, there's just no point. I know the ending. I know my choices don't matter and in a fit of intellectual laziness, the devs have sauntered off to collect my money.

I gave gameplay an average because as a squad shooter, it's just that. Controls are tight but even when set to use abilities, squad members frequently won't. I had to manually activate Ashley's marksman ability most of the time. Also, while you can order your squadmates to move somewhere, they won't always stay. Which results in them getting killed by heavy fire because they left the good position you had them in.

The game's storyline was good, but the ending was atrocious. It is wrapping up a trilogy of games. I expected two things. First, that it would show me glimpses of the main characters' lives in the aftermath. Secondly, that it would have a happy ending (yes, I got the ""good"" one). The ending was fifteen seconds of footage showing Joker and two other seemingly random characters. It was, in short (pun intended), awful.

I had to rate ""Lasting Appeal"" low for that reason. I can't imagine replaying the game to see that ending. Also, there is about 10 minutes of dialogue at the end that cannot be skipped.

The wait felt like forever and I couldn't wait to finally get back into the wasteland. Overall I like the game like making cool settlements, crafting, etc, but there is one problem that I find very noticeable after completing the main quests. There is not enough side quests in this game and after you go around looking at places, you slowly start to realize that there is not much else to do. The repeating quests are annoying after some time and you just stop doing those. I saw a comparison between quests in Fallout 4 and Skyrim. Skyrim nearly doubles all of Fallout 4's quests all together, so it sucks that Bethesda didn't add more. Now this is where DLC comes into play so people will have to buy dlc to be able to play more quests. The other Fallout games seem to have more things to do in my opinion. Although, Fallout 4 has lots of different MAIN quests that include I think 3-4 different factions to choose from so returning back to the game and trying something new is always something to look forward to. But I noticed that within the first 10 mins of the game, I felt like something was missing. I'm still not sure why I thought/think that but it just didn't have the full Fallout feel to it even though it is a wasteland. Overall I still like the game, but am disappointed in the lack of quests in the game. I guess the only thing to really look up to is the mods which hopefully come to xbox/ps4, and to see how well the dlc plays out. 7.5/10",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,5 years ago,,4.0,4.4535,1182,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10122221%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=330,58626914,65ca3938-e4c1-56e0-af65-250c2bf3f912,2022-01-16T16:19:25

My main complaints are the very common crashes and bugs. There is nothing worse than having your game crash and having to redo what you just did. My game has crashed at least 15 times and I have gotten stuck in places and had to reload at least 5. After lvl 20 I had to play on the hardest difficulty to have any fun, and even then the only real challenge is finding ammo. I have tossed out 95% of the ""Legendary"" Armor and weapons I get because they are pointless. This game was clearly produced with giant holes they intend to fill later with dlc. New weapons, power armor upgrades, new furniture etc. I have used the same gun for 30lvls. Building a village was one thing I was seriously looking forward to but they managed to ruin it, by making it mostly cosmetic and tedious. The best guns and armor will always be bought elsewhere, and having a camp barely helps you in game and constantly having to build and defend new ones with no gain gets old quick. It could be a great game. Bethesda has great ideas, but putting out a bug infested game that's not finished was a bad idea.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,0,0,6 years ago,,3.0,4.4535,1182,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10122221%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=330,56305513,055e8555-b5b9-5a86-97bf-a1a8416da4b1,2022-01-16T16:19:25

First off, I've had a lot of fun playing it. It was tough at first, but I got to be at a level playing field with the mobs at around level 15. There were times when I would roll through what looked liked a deserted town, just to find out it was full of ghouls that would attack you like zombies from the movie 28 Days. I really started to enjoy myself then. There's so much to do, between quest missions, building settlements, scavenging for supplies, and just exploring the world. At first, I had a lot of fun building the settlements, building defenses, and walling off the perimeter to protect the settlement. Just to find out, it's pretty much all for nothing. If you don't see the little notification of a settlement being attacked (because your on a quest, in the workshop menu, or just plain distracted at the time) since you have to be there to defend it, you'll go back to all your crops, defenses, and generators wrecked and having to be repaired. It's quite frustrating to have 40 water, 40 food, 20 settlers, and 140 defense, just to find out it's all for nothing if you can't be there to help defend. The whole point of building these defenses, is to leave the settlement knowing they are defended. But if you're not there to help defend it, a few raiders can just walk in and destroy everything. Pretty dumb and a waste of time if you ask me. I even tried double walls on one of my smaller settlements with no way in or out, only way in was to fast travel to the marker inside the walls. And it still got wrecked!! So don't waste too much of your time or resources building up defenses, cause it won't matter if you're not there to defend it and you'll just have to use a lot more resources to repair everything. Other than that, I really enjoy the game. The sounds of distant firefights in the distance, that you can join in or avoid, is outstanding. The way you can collect different power armor suits is great. I haven't ran into any of the bugs that have been reported, so I've been lucky there.

I'll tell you my biggest peeve with this game, you know how in Fallout 3, you had to work real hard for your power armor? Well in this one, you're handed your armor in the first like 3 missions. Yep, now you have a set of (over) power(ed) armor to use the rest of the game. Albeit, they require fusion cores to operate, which you find very scarcely. Other than that, it really just feels like Fallout 3 with amazing graphics. Nothing much new here, pretty disappointed.

What crafting system? You can't craft anything, all you can do is MODIFY the weapons and armor you find, and all the armor you find is the same stuff you find in Fallout 3. Nothing different!

Before I list what I love but I will point out what I see as the two main issues. 1. They really hindered role playing. Not a huge thing for me but I know this really bothers a lot of people. The voiced protagonist and dialogue options really hurt this method of playing. 2. They removed the karma system. This really bothers me as I always saw this as a really cool defining characteristic of the Fallout series and I just don't understand why they would remove this. This also kind of ties in to the first issue. However, they really did make an excellent game. I think the synth story line really encapsulates the red scare era that Fallout has always had. (Your neighbor could be a synth!/ Your neighbor could be a commie!) The base building has eaten away hours of my life, it's incredible. Could use some tweaks, but it is their first time implementing it so overall a success. The map may technically be smaller, but it's so much more content filled than previous games with just tons to do. Overall, incredible game, I already have dozens of hours into and I would 100% recommend it.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,6 years ago,,4.0,4.4535,1182,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10122221%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=350,55939889,2bd3768b-e213-5e37-9ff3-9ea410b5120b,2022-01-16T16:19:27

I didn't have that feeling when I played, it had felt like a good ol' Fallout game. It's an RPG that has guns with so much variations. Of course there is going to be the sense of a shoot em' up but that's minus the little kids spewing out words that us adults don't say over the internet. Don't forget you have a melee system and you are able to customize hand to hand combat weapons.

I lost the track of time because this game is very entertaining, the graphics may not be the best to other gamers but I thought they were great in comparison to the past Fallouts and it being Next-Gen. Keep in mind you are going to have glitches or some other issue... It is no different from the other Fallouts or the other great titles; someone had mentioned the Witcher III: that game had a 17gb update shortly after they released DLC. As long as you let the developers know, they will fix it, it isn't the end of the world regardless of the sticker price of the game. Every highly anticipated game is going to have bug/glitch fixes.

You want a game that will entertain you for continuous hours? This is the game for you; especially if you are a Fallout fan. You are able to build and customize just about anything and don't forget about all those amazing perks to make your character just as awesome as you are.

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-4/products/fallout-4---playstation-4/10122221.html,Fallout 4 - PlayStation 4,Bethesda Softworks,119073,ArmedSolution,An epic. A Video Game epic.,"I'm going to start this with a reminder that unlike what some would like to believe, this is MY opinion. Whether or not you like it is up to you.

Fallout 3 and New Vegas to me were great games although their charm wore off quickly or started just a little too slowly for my taste. They wouldn't last long on consoles but for PC they're pretty much INFINITELY replayable due to its modding community. This game nailed the pacing.

Initially as I started, it felt a little weird playing this. Not due to sloppy controls but more due to the extensive changes made to the UI. After about an hour or two with the game though it quickly wears off, as pretty soon you'll just as fast or even faster than you would in the previous Fallout games. The game controls nicely and feels fluid. This was especially good because in the last two the controls were kinda stiff and occasionally acted weird but this made it work fast and not drop input as often as I thought it would.

The graphics, while great have some issues. I noticed some strange lighting in certain areas where there wasn't a source which struck me as odd and kind of took me out but otherwise was done quite well. Some textures are kinda low res but with a game this size I'm not surprised at it. Otherwise this game is gorgeous. Bethesda's efforts at overhauling a game that still admittedly had that 2007 feel to them was not wasted, and for the most part everything works the way it should. The colors while you might think is something superfluous, I think matters. In this Fallout, its bright but still has that level of wear and tear from both the nuclear bomb damage and 200 years of everything thrown its way. Rather than maintaining that same muddy color scheme that tended to look rather depressing at times, the pre-war setting still at least has some soul to it.

For gameplay it's gotten quite a few new additions. Besides the standard shooter mechanics which have been round off quite well, Bethesda now shows us what it means to have a deeper sense of interactivity. Modding weapons returns from New Vegas returns with quite a twist, allowing for mods to be created from scratch using the new scrap system and they aren't just for looks or some minor buff, these are mods that have trade offs but also huge advantages to allow different playstyles to emerge. The settlements, while I think a good idea on paper, tend to feel like they get in the way. I never thought that they shouldn't be implemented, but I find that constantly being shown that a base isn't operating well at all when I was just starting out to be annoying, as it almost expected me to just drop my initial questing to fix things up with zero scrap. If it were up to me, I would have allowed it at a little bit of a later level, when you've gotten most of your startup out of the way. Cooking has now been implemented, which actually is somewhat good, as cooked food will be much better for you than just eating stuff raw. Speaking of which, the health system has been revised as well. Instead of having a RAD counter, it now sort of locks off part of your health bar which makes sense to me, and food/healing items are now all time based which makes for some extra planning. V.A.T.S. and the AP system have also gotten some changes with V.A.T.S. no longer pausing action completely, but slowing it down to add a little bit more of that hectic feel to a fight and you can now sprint which uses AP. Critical hits are measured on a meter and kills in V.A.T.S. raises it, encouraging you to use it. The Leveling system is an interesting one. Most fans of the previous Fallout games will say that the removal of the skill system is some form of sacrilege but I find it to be fine. Rather than having skills and perks, your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats are now the determining factor of the perks you get. Leveling up gives you one allocation point that can be either applied to one of the perk levels on a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. or the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attribute itself. There is no longer a level cap which is quite nice and allows for the possibility of fully leveling a character. You know that previous junk that you probably only used once in a blue moon with the Rock-it Launcher? Now it's part of the scrap system, where you will desperately searching for anything that you can use to craft weapon mods or things for your settlements, and it can get quite hectic at times. No longer are all items you find pointless. Power Armor has changed as well. Previous games saw you getting a perk that allowed you to wear the armor and then you would wear it for the forseeable future due to its potent effects compared to most other armor. Now, Power Armor has its own unique feel. Rather than acting like a second skin which wasn't supposed to be the intent based on the art design, Power Armor has impact. You really feel like a hulking monster walking around in a suit that allows for you to hit the snot out of your enemies and other kinds of things. While this may make it sound like its even more overpowered than before, it isn't and that's because it requires a fusion core to work, otherwise you'll be forced to walk around and you won't able to use V.A.T.S. while inside an empty suit. It also can take damage on specific parts so your limbs can be exposed if you take too much damage. Armor customization has also become a feature which applies to both the power armor and normal armor. Normal armor allows for you to choose a base (Vault 111 suit, long johns, harness, etc.), Right arm plating, Left arm plating, Right leg plating, Left leg plating, and a helmet, glasses and mouth covering or just a full helmet/mask. Power armor uses the mainframe of any suit but allows for different effects to be applied to different areas to allow for playstyle.

The story is one where a simple motivation is all it needed. Is it perfect? Not all the time, the writing can fail to make you feel something but most of the time, you definitely feel as though you make an impact based upon your actions. The whole goal of the game is to find your son Shaun, but the side-quests add more variety for the player. As with most RPGs side-quests can become repetitive, but with mediation between your main/faction quests and side-quests can allow for a better feeling of satisfaction. In the title you may have noticed the word epic. If you're thinking that it was just a buzzword, then you've got the wrong meaning. The story is an epic just like say Odyssey. You've got a simple goal that is made monumental in scope, with some plot digressions to mix things up a bit. I never felt as though the game ran stale, though I imagine as time passes and people ""complete"" the game, it could lose some value but there is one last thing to save the console versions of the game.

Bethesda announced mod support for consoles. Yes, you read that right, mod support. For too long, the console versions were inferior to the PC because you were never allowed to modify your experience. Sometime in 2016, the Creation Kit for Fallout 4 along with the mod support for Xbox One and PS4 will be added and allow for much more interesting experiences once you've finished your main game. This is already on top of DLCs and a reasonably priced Season Pass.

In conclusion, Fallout 4 is a game you will want. With so much content and (mostly) good writing at your hands, you will be able to experience things only this series can bring, and the ability to modify will undoubtedly be a major factor in this game's lifespan. If you can overlook the minor things to be expect of a game this large, you can have a great experience.

TL;DR: Mostly good graphics, great wealth of additions to gameplay to switch things up, story is mostly good with some writing falling to pieces, Mod support will expand lifespan, new UI may throw you off but is otherwise easy to use.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,6 years ago,,4.0,4.4535,1182,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10122221%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=360,54304513,e20accaf-d8dd-58b2-b567-4f0933c4a555,2022-01-16T16:19:28

The story I can't relate to it in a Fallout style because it feels to much like a Call of Duty shooter style where you have to go and absolutely kill EVERYTHING. And yes I emphasized that because when you have to kill an area it basically anything in that area no way around. It now a shooter more so than an RPG style.

The dialog lacks a bit, the characters don't show emotions as well as I expected they would. It more or less the same outcome despite what decision you make, you can't really go in a different direction all together.

Now an aspect I do like, but it not quite enough for me to refer this game is I love the crafting, but it doesn't keep a lasting appeal for to long considering there are other games out there with crafting now that have a better purpose.

And I like the outfit choice coming back where you can wear anything you want to and it doesn't change how people see you.

Basically I gave it a five star as a moral rating if anything because there pretty equal features I like and don't like. They just have different type of standing in the game.

This Game has them all, the famous arch enemies of the caped crusader including the joker, clayface, killer croc, and poison ivy. Plus like any other lego game you have an in game lobby were u can do various things such as play missions and collect studs. In batman u get to explore the bat cave and arkham asylum. like in lego star wars 2 u can make a custom character however you want which is still pretty fun to do.Also there are villian missions that show the other side of all the hero missions where you see how the villians concoct there master plan.

It was amazing how there is so many characters and missions. Plus all their powers they have and the suits, and the mini clips. My favorite funny clip for now is probably the part where Cat woman kissed Batman and then Robin took his tongue out and looked like he was grossed out! Also on the villains side my favorite power from joker is the electric buzzer, because every time you shock someone it's like they're getting a x-ray but getting shocked out the same time. I can't wait to finish the whole game, then I probably would want a LEGO Batman 2 then,3 and then continuing until they can't make any more but it kinda would help by taking most of the films they make like the cartoon, reality, and LEGO films they show and make take it and put it in the game!

I was disappointed with Lego Indiana Jones, which left much to be desired. However as I hoped Batman has been awesome. Before Batman, Lego has based their game-play solely off movie storyline and action. Batman has it’s own unique storyline, and short clips between chapters in the game which are awesome and funny. The unique story allows for new Bat-Suits, new gear, new ablities, and new things are not just for Batman but also for Robin. Also your main page is in the Bat Cave, or as villains in Arkham. You also get access to all the Bat-Gear, Bat-boat, Bat-Wing, Bat-mobile. Oh yeah, players also get to play as the villains in their own games separate from those of Batman!

Japanese anime schoolgirls in swimmy suits shooting water guns at each other 3rd person areba shooter style. Splatoon 2 with bewbs. This is where most people would say, ""I normally don't buy these types of games but I had to for the artistic merits and incredible story."" Not me. I like anything controversial and everything that goes against what the powers that be say is wrong, inappropriate, or politically incorrect. (I am also a fan of pretty anime schoolgirls and I do not apologize for that!)  I should probably mention this right now,  I hate Sony and I hate PlayStation for reasons I will not go into here. Let's just say fool me once shame on me, fool me 126 times, it must be Sony. I gave up fighting Sony and we finally bought a PS4 this year. I still hate Sony but I was missing out on too many games by fighting against them.  So I went over to the dark side, and it wasn't so bad after all. While Xbox still has it's amazing perks and features not found on PS4, I have found that Sony does some things Xbox has failed to do. What they do is JRPGS, fan service games, side scrolling shooters, and most importantly physical releases of games and true exclusives without the ""Play Anywhere"" pandering to the PC Master Race that Xbox does. Several of my favorite B-movie style games are PS4 exclusives, Onechanbara, Earth Defence Force, etc.which were formally Xbox 360 exclusive titles. The likes of Hatsune Miku and the Tales of... Series, among many others, are only found on PS4. Then there's Senran Kagura, and many others, in oversized collectors edition boxes. I loves me some collectors editions! Xbox has none anymore. While both companies are trying to force everyone to buy digital only games, it's great that PS4 hasn't yet crossed the line and Eliminated collectors editions.  I know this was supposed to be a review of Peach Beach Splash, but the game really speaks for itself. A fairly good tps with loads of fan service and a funny script.  The real point of this review is to state that it's time to urge others to buy both consoles this generation, just as we have in the past generations. Xbox has an amazing Backwards Compatibility library and some truly great games, Sony has the Japanese games library and some huge exclusives. Then there's Switch.... All I can say is there's potential there, and some day it will be worth buying. It's time to stop being fanboys and love both systems... Or in my case, tolerate the other's existence.",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,1,2,3 years ago,,5.0,4.4935,77,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10149320%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=30,113885540,c8ace2c8-90b7-5e3e-94e8-11e0d33d9360,2022-01-16T16:19:28

But I did it anyways and boy am I glad I did. It is Bethesda game so yes there will be glitches and bugs and the occasional game freeze. But if you are at familiar with their games you know that it wont take anything away from the game. Graphics wise I think they are in par with Witcher and other games I have played on PS4, Nothing spectacular but surely not anything to not pick the game up for. Combat is by far the most improved aspect from the previous Fallouts. Weaponry and armor are completely customizable and running and gunning is now an option. It is not as smooth as COD but a great improvement, one that I am greatly pleased with.

I played this after the FFXIII series, FFXV, and FF7 remake. The graphics are in the realm of FFXIII. Definitely, not as good as FFXV or 7 remake, but an older game, so that makes sense. There are elements of other older FF games - for those long time fans. I like being able to explore the overworld. Reminds me of the 1st and 6th games. The military campaign missions are fun. They remind me of the game of Risk. Leveling up is a bit of a chore, but XP grinds just go that way. Secret training missions are a quick way though, but that feels like cheating. The story is good, and detailed. It takes a second play through to pick up some of the nuances. I find the amount of characters a bit overwhelming, but I think it was done that way to make multiple play throughs fresh. Otherwise, it would get old quick. Trophies are realistic for those who care, but be prepared to work for some. I was a bit bummed about the music, some of it is okay, but I don't think I will like this soundtrack. The other FF games have always had the best music. Good for study and work type stuff. This one, ehh, not so much. In summary, fun, different, but not at the level of FFXV or remake 7. If you are a FF fan, you will like it, but for those just getting into the franchise, pass until you have tasted the excellence of the others.

Samsung's VA and FHD made me tip towards Dell. Also, I've always had Dell Ultrasharp monitors and never was disappointed. But then Samsung released the CRG90 with QHD resolution, the same 1800R curve (vs Dell's 3800R) and high refresh rate. Totally won me over and bought it right away. Box came in with no damage and obviously never opened before. So I was happy with that. Assembly was quick and easy. Never actually touched the display until it was on my desk. Then I noticed huge hand prints all over the left and right edges of screen. There were not bare oily hand prints, more dusty glove prints from whoever packaged it. A quick dust off with microfiber cleaned them right up. Struggled a lot with the provided cables. Power is only 5 feet. Considering the routing in the back panel and through the mount's arm, nearly 2 feet are already gone. So you better have an outlet nearby. DP, HDMI and USB cables are 6 feet each. Pretty standard but again, this monitor is huge; 4 feet across so again with the routing through the back panel and arm, there' no a whole lot of room to do good cable management. But, with a bit of patience and reorganizing the desk, all worked out fine. Then I plugged it in the PC using the provided DP cable, wow was I amazed at the....

The game is very one-dimensional in it's combat design and I have just gotten tired of playing it. I thought it would be great as we have been anticipating a release of the game into the Americas for a while, but it's just so simple and easy.

On top of that, the game sports a glaring design flaw in which players are punished for preferring purely melee characters with limited ranged attack ability. It's becoming a recurring theme in the game industry to neglect melee oriented players when it comes to design and it absolutely needs to stop.

Yes it can be respected that melee characters shouldn't be ranged, but even our greatest real life athletes can perform dazzling aerial feats at inhuman speed every once in a while.

It's really frustrating when I encounter something I cannot fight because it is exclusively ranged and will not come down and fight me because it is like I am screwed from the second I decided which character I wanted to play most just because it's ranged attack capability is so limited.

I mean your AI allies are practically braindead anyway. Why does this game even have a party system? They just get in the way/waste resources.

I didn't expect a lot being that it was a PSP port but it's been a pretty disappointing experience. But Birth by Sleep and God Eater were pretty similar games and were done a lot better. Surprisingly good even for PSP games and I say that not to knock all PSP games but because of the genre of the game and limitations that a PSP will have compared to a console system with more buttons and superior control.

I have no outstanding opinion on the sound of the game, good or bad. Graphically, the camera's motion blur was very annoying but otherwise solid. Pretty game, but pretty boring gameplay unfortunately.

This game may be more suited to more casual gamers who are not as bothered by lack of polish on a game, but by the time I was at Chapter 7 I just didn't care what was going on in the story because I was bored out of my mind even playing the game.

I could go tons and tons more into detail with my disappointments but I don't really think it's fair to keep bagging on the game for reasons I have already stated (age, porting a game developed for a handheld).",No: I don’t recommend this product,,5,2,6 years ago,,2.0,4.0427,117,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10115560%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=20,45121586,6263f886-ece5-5c04-8a38-db99ba2aca1e,2022-01-16T16:19:30

It hasn't kept my attention and playing it feels more like a chore at this point. The graphics are decent, but look like they were rendered on a ps3 instead of a ps4. combined with the disgusting motion blur effect for even slightly turning your gaze really put a damper on the graphics as they are only good looking when you stand still.
I liked the swap-out system for characters, and magic requirements for different spells felt natural. having to keep 12 characters leveled up and geared out at once was kind of annoying at first but I got used to it.

There is a decent amount of blood and destruction which kind of grips you. As far as all of the people complaining about the story and elements being so confusing, I don't really think they bothered to watch the in game CGs or read the in game historical texts. It is not that confusing and every element is explained if you take the time to look and listen. There are 3 levels of difficulty in the game and even on Cadet, it can be somewhat of a challenge. I grew up with turned based JRPGs and to write off this game because isn't turn based is a shame. Limiting yourself is unfortunate because the game is actually very good and provides well over 100 hours worth of content, replay, and activities. The camera can get you a little dazed but it isn't a deal breaker. The graphics could have certainly been remastered a little better but there are moments when the game looks absolutely fantastic. I use the remote play feature on my Vita sometimes and it plays amazingly considering it was originally a psp game. Square Enix should have offered this game as a Vita title as well but that is a different issue. The FF XV demo was a very nice addition and does take some getting used to. I own FF 1 through 14 and enjoy each game for its differences and uniqueness.

It's just an action-RPG, not a turn-based. It's a very refreshing change to the series. People complain that there are ranged enemies and they are using a full melee squad, well that's just dumb. It's still a Final Fantasy game so tactics are still used, a lot. You have to make a team that makes sense. If you play the turn-based versions, you wouldn't put 4 Tanks or 4 DPS in at once, why? Because it's stupid. That aside the combat is fun, given you have the brains to make the fun happen. Some characters are useless, a lot of them are really interesting.

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-4/products/final-fantasy-type-0-hd/10115560.html,FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD,Square Enix,109553,MGS5Jon,It's worth getting for the demo.,"Type-0 is an okay game, I haven't finished the game yet but the story line is interesting enough to keep playing. The beginning of this game is what impressed me the most. The story telling and the emotional impact of the drama I found was like no other final fantasy. War is depicted in this game as ruthless, bloody, and ugly. An army ravaging a city hellbent on victory. You witness the slaughter of many. Those who are innocent civilians, those who at the moment of dying being finished off without hesitation. Then you witness one with the will to survive. It's agonizing to watch someone dying but at the same time inspiring to see the will to live. After the opening events I was left very solemn but excited to start playing this game. Probably the best opening to any Final Fantasy. I've played this game quite a bit but it doesn't continue with the same intensity of story telling. Then again i'm sure it has some great moments I haven't reached yet. It's a very unique game, kind of reminds me of Persona 4 somewhat. Type-0 actually blends quite a bit of other final fantasy elements into this game. I'm really not being really critical of this game, not everyone will enjoy certain aspects. I really think the level development/outlay of the areas you visit are basic/simple at best. Although i'm only 3 to 4 hours into this game, from what I saw this seems to be the norm. I'm positive this game will have quite a bit of replay value. More characters then any other Final Fantasy you will have at your disposal. Difficulty selection will be nice for the hardcore gamer. I started on the officer difficulty and it's not that challenging, at least not for me. The graphics are okay i'm not complaining. Although some people might think it's garbage because it doesn't resemble a next gen PlayStation 4 game. It's in high definition its very smooth/fluid. The textures such as the grass are not bad but then again it doesn't look like Final Fantasy XV. Speaking of Final Fantasy XV you get a code to download it. It's around 5.2 Gigabytes so download it. It's really fun, open world, great graphics, and a new fighting system. This demo is worth the purchase of Type-0 in my opinion. The demo will take you a few hours to complete, which is good because you won't finish it too fast. The time changes from day to night. The night invites tougher monsters for an added challenge and gains the group some experience you will get to reap once you rest at a campground. There's witty banter between the group as you explore the world which makes the travel a little more interesting as you travel to objectives. Getting in a battle, the enemy sees you a red line flashes across the screen until it expands the entire width of the screen. You can also hide by pressing/holding the L2 button, then get out of view behind a tree, or rock. It's also a really suspenseful game you will see once you start the hunt for ""Dead eye."" Also you will find a summon, you will like this A LOT! I did, but don't take my word for it, try it out yourself.

I consider myself a causal gamer and I first got introduced to horizon 3 and fell in love. The racing style combined with the great car selection and customization is an awesome mix. When I got horizon 4 I was relieved to find out how They kept all the good stuff the same but added more cool features such as weather change and character customization. Also there are new  and interesting events such as stunts and perks for your cars. As with all horizon games there is also a good balance of keeping it challenging and entertaining. Also very rewarding game. The more you put in the more you get out.,No: I don’t recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,0,0,2 years ago,,5.0,4.5827,1251,https://www.gamestop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-gamestop-us-Site/default/Bazaarvoice-RatingAndReviews?Filter=Productid%3a10163440%7cIsRatingsOnly%3aeq%3afalse&Sort=submissiontime%3adesc&Offset=80,127817060,1eaba7e7-b082-52ac-9cc8-b8c6bd6f5760,2022-01-16T16:19:31
